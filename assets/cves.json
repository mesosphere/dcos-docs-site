issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/istio/proxyv2@1.8.2","mitigations":[{"kind":"not_affected","description":"This vulnerability requires a program be compiled using the headers from an included Kernel source code package, that is not used.
