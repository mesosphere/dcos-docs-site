When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.

If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version.

This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.19.7","mitigations":[],"components":[],"purls":["pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.19.7","pkg:docker/external_storage/local-volume-provisioner@v2.3.2?repository_url=quay.io","pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.18.8-debian-10-r15","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.11","pkg:docker/bitnami/external-dns@0.7.0-debian-10-r0","pkg:docker/mesosphere/update-gitops-repo@1.4.0","pkg:docker/provider-aws/aws-ebs-csi-driver@v0.8.0?repository_url=k8s.gcr.io","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.1.9","pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.17","pkg:docker/nvidia/k8s-device-plugin@1.0.0-beta6","pkg:docker/mesosphere/dex-controller@v0.6.6","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.9","pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-dind@1.4.0","pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.19.2","pkg:docker/library/debian@buster-slim","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.0","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.12","pkg:docker/nvidia/pod-gpu-metrics-exporter@v1.0.0-alpha","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.8","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.4.4","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.4.2","pkg:docker/kube-proxy@v1.19.7?repository_url=k8s.gcr.io","pkg:docker/kubecost1/frontend@prod-1.71.1?repository_url=gcr.io","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.3.0","pkg:docker/mesosphere/kube-proxy@v1.19.7_fips.1"]},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-6594","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-6594","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"The transit path validation code in Heimdal before 7.3 might allow attackers to bypass the capath policy protection mechanism by leveraging failure to add the previous hop realm to the transit path of issued tickets.","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io","mitigations":[],"components":[],"purls":["pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"]},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-8203","vulnerability_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8203","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"Prototype pollution attack when using _.zipObjectDeep in lodash before 4.17.20.","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kubecost1/checks@prod-1.71.1?repository_url=quay.io","mitigations":[],"components":[],"purls":["pkg:docker/kubecost1/checks@prod-1.71.1?repository_url=quay.io"]},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2021-23841","vulnerability_url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-23841","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases, errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH modes are not vulnerable.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@276.0.0-alpine","mitigations":[],"components":[],"purls":["pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@276.0.0-alpine","pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-gsutil@1.4.0"]},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-1000100","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-1000100","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"When doing a TFTP transfer and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very long file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to fit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated to use the untruncated length.

This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.","vulnerability_mitigation":"","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io","mitigations":[],"components":[],"purls":["pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"]},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-29361","vulnerability_url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-29361","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.21.1 through 0.23.21.
