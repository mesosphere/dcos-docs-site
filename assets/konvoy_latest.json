The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/stedolan/jq@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2013-4392","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4392","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"systemd, when updating file permissions, allows local users to change the permissions and SELinux security contexts for arbitrary files via a symlink attack on unspecified files.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.0"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-17595","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-17595","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"There is a heap-based buffer over-read in the fmt_entry function in tinfo/comp_hash.c in the terminfo library in ncurses before 6.1-20191012.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.1.9"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-19923","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19923","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"flattenSubquery in select.c in SQLite 3.30.1 mishandles certain uses of SELECT DISTINCT involving a LEFT JOIN in which the right-hand side is a view.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/provider-aws/aws-ebs-csi-driver@v0.8.0?repository_url=k8s.gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-20839","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20839","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"systemd 242 changes the VT1 mode upon a logout, which allows attackers to read cleartext passwords in certain circumstances, such as watching a shutdown, or using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F2.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/lmierzwa/karma@v0.55"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-36224","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36224","vulnerability_severity":"unknown","vulnerability_description":"A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to an invalid pointer free and slapd crash in the saslAuthzTo processing, resulting in denial of service.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/istio/operator@1.8.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-27619","vulnerability_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27619","vulnerability_severity":"critical","vulnerability_description":"In Python 3 through 3.9.0, the Lib/test/multibytecodec_support.py CJK codec tests call eval() on content retrieved via HTTP.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar@1.1.0"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-18276","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.18.8-debian-10-r15"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-25656","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-25656","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The amount of resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private key that is shared between multiple clients. This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.","vulnerability_mitigation":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.9","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2010-0928","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0928","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply voltage for the microprocessor, related to a \"fault-based attack.\"","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-dind@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2008-3234","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3234","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"sshd in OpenSSH 4 on Debian GNU/Linux, and the 20070303 OpenSSH snapshot, allows remote authenticated users to obtain access to arbitrary SELinux roles by appending a :/ (colon slash) sequence, followed by the role name, to the username.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-8817","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8817","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"The FTP wildcard function in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a string that ends with an '[' character.","vulnerability_mitigation":"7.47.0-1ubuntu2.5","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-25284","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-25284","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe.","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.15.0-126.129","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-16231","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16231","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"** DISPUTED ** In PCRE 8.41, after compiling, a pcretest load test PoC produces a crash overflow in the function match() in pcre_exec.c because of a self-recursive call.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/kube-proxy@v1.19.7_fips"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-10790","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-10790","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"The _asn1_check_identifier function in GNU Libtasn1 through 4.12 causes a NULL pointer dereference and crash when reading crafted input that triggers assignment of a NULL value within an asn1_node structure.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.

The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-28974","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-28974","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"A slab-out-of-bounds read in fbcon in the Linux kernel before 5.9.7 could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or potentially crash the kernel, aka CID-3c4e0dff2095.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/argoproj/argocd@v1.6.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-9192","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9192","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"** DISPUTED ** In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c has Uncontrolled Recursion, as demonstrated by '(|)(\\\\1\\\\1)*' in grep, a different issue than CVE-2018-20796.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2.22.3-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@276.0.0-alpine"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-15780","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15780","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c in the Linux kernel before 5.7.7.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.16.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-9893","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9893","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"libseccomp before 2.4.0 did not correctly generate 64-bit syscall argument comparisons using the arithmetic operators (LT, GT, LE, GE), which might able to lead to bypassing seccomp filters and potential privilege escalations.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.18.8-debian-10-r15"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-1000654","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000654","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"GNU Libtasn1-4.13 libtasn1-4.13 version libtasn1-4.13, libtasn1-4.12 contains a DoS, specifically CPU usage will reach 100% when running asn1Paser against the POC due to an issue in _asn1_expand_object_id(p_tree), after a long time, the program will be killed.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kube-proxy@v1.19.7?repository_url=k8s.gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-25656","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-25656","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@293.0.0-slim"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2010-4651","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4651","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in util.c in GNU patch 2.6.1 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a filename that is specified with a ..

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.17"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-10711","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10711","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7.

While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2.22.4-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2013-7040","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7040","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x.

This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@293.0.0-slim"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-17740","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17740","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"contrib/slapd-modules/nops/nops.c in OpenLDAP through 2.4.45, when both the nops module and the memberof overlay are enabled, attempts to free a buffer that was allocated on the stack, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slapd crash) via a member MODDN operation.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/bitnami/kubectl@1.19.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-24490","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-24490","vulnerability_severity":"unknown","vulnerability_description":"","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.19.146-1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@293.0.0-slim"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-19072","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19072","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"A memory leak in the predicate_parse() function in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-96c5c6e6a5b6.","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.19.146-1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-20671","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20671","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"load_specific_debug_section in objdump.c in GNU Binutils through 2.31.1 contains an integer overflow vulnerability that can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted section size.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-5482","vulnerability_url":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5482","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"Heap buffer overflow in the TFTP protocol handler in cURL 7.19.4 to 7.65.3.","vulnerability_mitigation":"7.66.0-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-19525","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-19525","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"In the Linux kernel before 5.3.6, there is a use-after-free bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/net/ieee802154/atusb.c driver, aka CID-7fd25e6fc035.","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.19.87-1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2021-20177","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-20177","vulnerability_severity":"unknown","vulnerability_description":"","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-dind@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-6951","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6951","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in GNU patch through 2.7.6.

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2.22.4-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@276.0.0-alpine"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2016-2781","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2781","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal's input buffer.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/velero/velero@v1.5.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-5094","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-5094","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the quota file functionality of E2fsprogs 1.45.3.

While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.

However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/fluent/fluent-bit@1.6.8"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-27350","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27350","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"APT had several integer overflows and underflows while parsing .deb packages, aka GHSL-2020-168 GHSL-2020-169, in files apt-pkg/contrib/extracttar.cc, apt-pkg/deb/debfile.cc, and apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc.

This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-dind@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-5337","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5337","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the read_attribute function in GnuTLS before 3.3.26 and 3.5.x before 3.5.8 allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted OpenPGP certificate.","vulnerability_mitigation":"3.3.8-6+deb8u5","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/stedolan/jq@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-20673","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20673","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"The demangle_template function in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31.1, contains an integer overflow vulnerability (for \"Create an array for saving the template argument values\") that can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, as demonstrated by nm.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/argoproj/argocd@v1.6.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-27825","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27825","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"A use-after-free flaw was found in kernel/trace/ring_buffer.c in Linux kernel (before 5.10-rc1).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/nginx@1.19.0"},{"vulnerability_name":"GHSA-p9pc-299p-vxgp","vulnerability_url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9pc-299p-vxgp","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"","vulnerability_mitigation":"13.1.2","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kibana/kibana-oss@6.8.10?repository_url=docker.elastic.co"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-8283","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8283","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"dpkg-source in dpkg 1.3.0 through 1.18.23 is able to use a non-GNU patch program and does not offer a protection mechanism for blank-indented diff hunks, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a crafted Debian source package, as demonstrated by use of dpkg-source on NetBSD.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-18018","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18018","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"In GNU Coreutils through 8.29, chown-core.c in chown and chgrp does not prevent replacement of a plain file with a symlink during use of the POSIX \"-R -L\" options, which allows local users to modify the ownership of arbitrary files by leveraging a race condition.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/kubeaddons-addon-initializer@v0.2.0"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-28928","vulnerability_url":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-28928","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"In musl libc through 1.2.1, wcsnrtombs mishandles particular combinations of destination buffer size and source character limit, as demonstrated by an invalid write access (buffer overflow).","vulnerability_mitigation":"1.1.22-r4","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kubernetes-multicluster/kubefed@v0.5.1?repository_url=quay.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-5481","vulnerability_url":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5481","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"Double-free vulnerability in the FTP-kerberos code in cURL 7.52.0 to 7.65.3.","vulnerability_mitigation":"7.66.0-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2010-0928","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0928","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"OpenSSL 0.9.8i on the Gaisler Research LEON3 SoC on the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA uses a Fixed Width Exponentiation (FWE) algorithm for certain signature calculations, and does not verify the signature before providing it to a caller, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to determine the private key via a modified supply voltage for the microprocessor, related to a \"fault-based attack.\"","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/stedolan/jq@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-1010024","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010024","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"** DISPUTED ** GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/update-gitops-repo@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2016-7444","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7444","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"The gnutls_ocsp_resp_check_crt function in lib/x509/ocsp.c in GnuTLS before 3.4.15 and 3.5.x before 3.5.4 does not verify the serial length of an OCSP response, which might allow remote attackers to bypass an intended certificate validation mechanism via vectors involving trailing bytes left by gnutls_malloc.","vulnerability_mitigation":"3.3.8-6+deb8u4","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/stedolan/jq@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-7608","vulnerability_url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7608","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kibana/kibana-oss@6.8.10?repository_url=docker.elastic.co"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-20796","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-20796","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1 in posix/regexec.c has Uncontrolled Recursion, as demonstrated by '(\\227|)(\\\\1\\\\1|t1|\\\\\\2537)+' in grep.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/nginx@1.19.0"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-12351","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-12351","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"Improper input validation in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via adjacent access.","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.15.0-122.124","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-27835","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-27835","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"A use after free in the Linux kernel infiniband hfi1 driver in versions prior to 5.10-rc6 was found in the way user calls Ioctl after open dev file and fork.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/jettech/kube-webhook-certgen@v1.2.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-5407","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5407","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) in processors can enable local users to exploit software vulnerable to timing attacks via a side-channel timing attack on 'port contention'.","vulnerability_mitigation":"1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.14","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google_containers/kubernetes-dashboard-init-amd64@v1.0.0?repository_url=gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-10543","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-10543","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflow because nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow.","vulnerability_mitigation":"5.22.1-9ubuntu0.9","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper@v3.0.4-beta.1?repository_url=quay.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-17450","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-17450","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"find_abstract_instance in dwarf2.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion and application crash) via a crafted ELF file.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-36226","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36226","vulnerability_severity":"unknown","vulnerability_description":"A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a memch-\u003ebv_len miscalculation and slapd crash in the saslAuthzTo processing, resulting in denial of service.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/update-gitops-repo@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-6829","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6829","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).

Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2.22.4-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/cederstone/git-daemon@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2017-13693","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-13693","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"The acpi_ds_create_operands() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/dsutils.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/argoproj/argocd@v1.6.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-16230","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-16230","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"** DISPUTED ** drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2.22.4-r0","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-gsutil@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-3693","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-3693","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a speculative buffer overflow and side-channel analysis.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/google/cloud-sdk@293.0.0-slim"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-6096","vulnerability_url":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-6096","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000.

This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/library/golang@1.13.0-buster"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2010-4051","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4051","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"The regcomp implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.11.3, and 2.12.x through 2.12.2, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a regular expression containing adjacent bounded repetitions that bypass the intended RE_DUP_MAX limitation, as demonstrated by a {10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,} sequence in the proftpd.gnu.c exploit for ProFTPD, related to a \"RE_DUP_MAX overflow.\"","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/provider-aws/aws-ebs-csi-driver@v0.8.0?repository_url=k8s.gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2005-2541","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-2541","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"Tar 1.15.1 does not properly warn the user when extracting setuid or setgid files, which may allow local users or remote attackers to gain privileges.","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/argoproj/argocd@v1.6.2"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-15358","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-15358","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"In SQLite before 3.32.3, select.c mishandles query-flattener optimization, leading to a multiSelectOrderBy heap overflow because of misuse of transitive properties for constant propagation.","vulnerability_mitigation":"3.27.2-3+deb10u1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-8169","vulnerability_url":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8169","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"curl 7.62.0 through 7.70.0 is vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability that can lead to a partial password being leaked over the network and to the DNS server(s).","vulnerability_mitigation":"7.66.0-r1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dex-k8s-authenticator@v1.2.2-d2iq"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2020-12464","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12464","vulnerability_severity":"high","vulnerability_description":"usb_sg_cancel in drivers/usb/core/message.c in the Linux kernel before 5.6.8 has a use-after-free because a transfer occurs without a reference, aka CID-056ad39ee925.","vulnerability_mitigation":"4.19.118-2+deb10u1","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-argocd@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2015-8393","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8393","vulnerability_severity":"medium","vulnerability_description":"pcregrep in PCRE before 8.38 mishandles the -q option for binary files, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted file, as demonstrated by a CGI script that sends stdout data to a client.","vulnerability_mitigation":"2:8.35-3.3+deb8u2","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/stedolan/jq@latest"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2018-19932","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-19932","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils through 2.31.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/kubecost1/frontend@prod-1.71.1?repository_url=gcr.io"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-18660","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18660","vulnerability_severity":"low","vulnerability_description":"The Linux kernel before 5.4.1 on powerpc allows Information Exposure because the Spectre-RSB mitigation is not in place for all applicable CPUs, aka CID-39e72bf96f58.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.

The security of Dual EC DRBG relies on the difficulty of computing the discrete logarithm of Q base P.  While computing discrete logarithms is a cryptographically hard problem, infeasible from an attack perspective, it would be possible for these parameters to be generated in such a way that this logarithm is known.  This has raised concerns that the DRBG could conceal a trapdoor, allowing those who generated P and Q in this way to predict outputs from the DRBG after collecting a small number of sample outputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that Dual EC DRBG is only vulnerable to this attack if the parameters were generated in this way.  If the parameters were both generated randomly and independently, this attack would not be feasible.  However, because the provenance of the default values for P and Q are not known, security researchers are not able to verify the trustworthiness of this algorithm with the default parameters.\n\nFor the purposes of scoring this vulnerability, it will be assumed that the relationship between P and Q described above is known to the attacker.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL ITL BULLETIN FOR SEPTEMBER 2013:\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/itlbul2013_09_supplemental.pdf","vulnerability_mitigation":"None","project_name":"konvoy","project_slug":"konvoy","project_version":"v1.7.0-rc.1-9-g8c9dd31d","resource_kind":"docker","resource_purl":"pkg:docker/mesosphere/dispatch-entrypoint@1.3.1"},{"vulnerability_name":"CVE-2019-18276","vulnerability_url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276","vulnerability_severity":"negligible","vulnerability_description":"An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11.
