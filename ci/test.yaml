                                matching the selector will be matched. \n Note that: in
                                addition to the negated version of the Selector (see NotSelector
                                below), the selector expression syntax itself supports
                                negation.  The two types of negation are subtly different.
                                One negates the set of matched endpoints, the other negates
                                the whole match: \n \tSelector = \"!has(my_label)\" matches

                              as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30%
                              of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at
                              least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node
                              is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for
                              any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is
                              drained) an updated pod is immediatedly created on that
                              node without considering surge limits. Allowing surge implies
                              the possibility that the resources consumed by the daemonset
                              on any given node can double if the readiness check fails,
                              and so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account
                              that they may cause evictions during disruption. This is
                              an alpha field and requires enabling DaemonSetUpdateSurge
                              feature gate.'
