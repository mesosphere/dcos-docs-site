By default, a [new user](/docs/1.10/security/ent/users-groups/) has no permissions and cannot view the DC/OS GUI. You must grant users and groups access to each tab of the GUI tab.

**Important:** Only [superusers](/docs/1.10/security/ent/perms-reference/#superuser) can view the Dashboard, Nodes, or System Overview tabs.
