# Swagger Specification

The specification below describes all possible configuration options. The majority of fields have sensible defaults and should be modified with caution. Use the tool at [swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io/) to render this document in Swagger.

Consult the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/1.10/networking/edge-lb/quickstart) for an example of a real-life Edge-LB configuration.

See the [Examples](/docs/1.10/networking/edge-lb/examples) for more common use cases.

## Edge-LB v0.1.7

      * If a default is not set, then it will be left empty, even for objects.
      * Set defaults in the object that is furthest from the root object.
      * Always set a default for arrays.
      * The purpose of "x-nullable" is to allow the output JSON field to be set
        to the golang "zero value". Without "x-nullable", the field will be
        removed altogether from the resulting JSON.
      * Actual validation is done in the code, not expressed in swagger.
      * Since an empty boolean is interpreted as "false", don't set
        a default.
      * CamelCase
      * Swagger will only do enum validation if it is a top level definition!

# Configuration format

Edge-LB accepts configuration in YAML or JSON, but YAML is preferred for readability.

A helpful graphical visualization tool for swagger can be found at [editor.swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io)

# SSL/TLS certificates

See the [Examples](/docs/1.10/networking/edge-lb/examples#sample-certificates).

# Configuration format FAQ

## How do I convert YAML to JSON?

`dcos edgelb config --to-json=/path/to/json`

## How do I convert JSON to YAML?

There currently isn't an automated way to do this, the suggested method is to
hand convert it, and then use the YAML to JSON conversion on your YAML and
then do a diff between your YAML and the JSON.

```
# First hand convert JSON to YAML

# Then compare to original json with the `diff` shell command.
# Here we "convert" even the JSON file to get consistently formatted JSON
diff <(dcos edgelb config --to-json=myconfig.yaml) <(dcos edgelb config --to-json=myconfig.json)
```

## How do I create an empty object in YAML?

The syntax is the same as in JSON. For example, basic use of `sticky`
involves setting it to the empty object.

YAML:
```
  sticky: {}
```

JSON:
```
{
  "sticky": {}
}
```

## Where does JSON expect commas?

Put them everywhere except after the last element in an object or array.

```
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

```
{
  "key": ["value1", "value2"]
}
```
