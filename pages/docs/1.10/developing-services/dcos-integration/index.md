You can leverage several integration points when creating a DC/OS Service. The sections below explain how to integrate with each respective component.

# <a name="adminrouter"></a>Admin Router

When a DC/OS Service is installed and run on DC/OS, the service is generally deployed on a [private agent node][3]. To allow users to access a running instance of the service, Admin Router can function as a reverse proxy for the DC/OS Service.

The Admin Router currently supports only one reverse proxy destination.

## Service Endpoints

The Admin Router allows Marathon tasks to define custom service UI and HTTP endpoints, which are made available as `/service/<service-name>`. Set the following Marathon task labels to enable this:

```
"labels": {
    "DCOS_SERVICE_NAME": "<service-name>",
    "DCOS_SERVICE_PORT_INDEX": "0",
    "DCOS_SERVICE_SCHEME": "http"
  }
```

In this case, `http://<dcos-cluster>/service/<service-name>` would be forwarded to the host running the task using the first port allocated to the task.

In order for the forwarding to work reliably across task failures, we recommend co-locating the endpoints with the task. This way, if the task is restarted on another host and with different ports, Admin Router will pick up the new labels and update the routing. **Note:** Due to caching, there can be an up to 30-second delay before the new routing is working.

We recommend having only a single task setting these labels for a given service name. If multiple task instances have the same service name label, Admin Router will pick one of the task instances deterministically, but this might make debugging issues more difficult.

Since the paths to resources for clients connecting to Admin Router will differ from those paths the service actually has, ensure the service is configured to run behind a proxy. This often means relative paths are preferred to absolute paths. In particular, resources expected to be used by a UI should be verified to work through a proxy.

Tasks running in nested [Marathon app groups](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/application-groups.html) will be available only using their service name (i.e., `/service/<service-name>`), not by the Marathon app group name (i.e., `/service/app-group/<service-name>`).

# <a name="dcos-ui"></a>DC/OS UI

Service health check information can be surfaced in the DC/OS services UI tab by:

1. Defining one or more [healthChecks](/docs/1.10/deploying-services/creating-services/health-checks/) in the service's Marathon template, for example:

        "healthChecks": [
            {
                "path": "/",
                "portIndex": 1,
                "protocol": "HTTP",
                "gracePeriodSeconds": 5,
                "intervalSeconds": 60,
                "timeoutSeconds": 10,
                "maxConsecutiveFailures": 3
            }
        ]

2. Defining the label `DCOS_PACKAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME` in the Service's Marathon template, with the same value that will be used when the framework registers with Mesos. For example:

         "labels": {
            "DCOS_PACKAGE_FRAMEWORK_NAME": "unicorn"
          }

3. Setting `.framework` to true in `package.json`

# <a name="cli-subcommand"></a>CLI Subcommand

If you are publishing a DC/OS CLI subcommand for use with your service, the subcommand should communicate with the running service by sending HTTP requests through Admin Router to the service.

See [dcos-helloworld][6] for an example on how to develop a CLI subcommand.
