This tutorial shows you how to use Marathon-LB to run a containerized DC/OS service that serves a website. Specifically, you will use Docker image that contains NGINX, which serves the dcos.io site.

In this tutorial, Marathon-LB is used as the edge load balancer and service discovery mechanism. Marathon-LB is run on a public-facing node to route ingress traffic. 

### Prerequisites
- [A DC/OS cluster](/docs/1.9/installing/) with at least one [private](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#private) agent and one [public](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#public-agent-node) agent.
- [DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.9/cli/install/) is installed.
- Marathon-LB [installed](/docs/1.9/networking/marathon-lb/usage/).

# Configure and Run a Containerized Service on a Public Node

1.  Copy `dcos-website/dcos-website.json` from the [dcos-website](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-website/blob/develop/dcos-website.json) GitHub repository.
 
    1.  Go to the [mesosphere/dcos-website](https://hub.docker.com/r/mesosphere/dcos-website/tags/) Docker Hub repository and copy the latest image tag.
    
        ![Mesosphere Docker Hub](/docs/1.9/img/dockerhub.png)
        
    1.  Replace `<image-tag>` in the `docker:image` field with the tag. 
        
    1.  Locate and take note of [your public agent node](/docs/1.9/administering-clusters/locate-public-agent/) IP address.
    
    1. In the labels field, add an entry for `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` and assign it the value of your public agent IP. Remove the leading `http://` and the trailing `/` from the IP. Remember to add a comma after the preceding field.

        The complete JSON service definition file should resemble:
        
        ```json
        {
          "id": "dcos-website",
          "container": {
            "type": "DOCKER",
            "docker": {
              "image": "mesosphere/dcos-website:<image-tag>",
              "network": "BRIDGE",
              "portMappings": [
                { "hostPort": 0, "containerPort": 80, "servicePort": 10004 }
              ]
            }
          },
          "instances": 3,
          "cpus": 0.25,
          "mem": 100,
          "healthChecks": [{
              "protocol": "HTTP",
              "path": "/",
              "portIndex": 0,
              "timeoutSeconds": 2,
              "gracePeriodSeconds": 15,
              "intervalSeconds": 3,
              "maxConsecutiveFailures": 2
          }],
          "labels":{
            "HAPROXY_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP":"dcos-website",
            "HAPROXY_DEPLOYMENT_ALT_PORT":"10005",
            "HAPROXY_GROUP":"external",
            "HAPROXY_0_REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS":"true",
            "HAPROXY_0_VHOST": "<public-agent-ip>"
          }
        }
        ```

1.  Run the service from the DC/OS CLI using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add dcos-website.json
    ```

1.  Go to the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface to verify that your application is healthy.

1.  Go to your public agent to see the site running. For information about how to find your public agent IP, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/administering-clusters/locate-public-agent/).
