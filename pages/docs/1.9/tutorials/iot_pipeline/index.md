post_title: Deploying a Load-Balanced Data Pipeline
menu_order: 100
---

In this tutorial you install and deploy a containerized Ruby on Rails app named Tweeter. Tweeter is an app similar to Twitter that you can use to post 140-character messages to the internet. Then, you use Zeppelin to perform real-time analytics on the data created by Tweeter.

This tutorial demonstrates how you can build a complete IoT pipeline on DC/OS in about 15 minutes! You will learn:

*   How to install DC/OS services.
*   How to add apps to DC/OS Marathon.
*   How to route public traffic to the private application with Marathon-LB.
*   How your apps are discovered.
*   How to scale your apps. 

This tutorial uses DC/OS to launch and deploy these microservices to your cluster:

### Cassandra
The [Cassandra][1] database is used on the backend to store the Tweeter app data. 

### Kafka
The [Kafka][2] publish-subscribe message service receives tweets from Cassandra and routes them to Zeppelin for real-time analytics.

### Marathon-LB
[Marathon-LB][12] is an HAProxy based load balancer for Marathon only. It is useful when you require external routing or layer 7 load balancing features.

### Zeppelin
[Zeppelin][4] is an interactive analytics notebook that works with DC/OS Spark on the backend to enable interactive analytics and visualization. Because it's possible for Spark and Zeppelin to consume all of your cluster resources, you must specify a maximum number of cores for the Zeppelin service.

### Tweeter
Tweeter stores tweets in the DC/OS Cassandra service, streams tweets to the DC/OS Kafka service in real-time, and performs real-time analytics with the DC/OS [Spark][3] and Zeppelin services.

**Prerequisites:**

*  [DC/OS](/docs/1.9/installing/) installed with at least 5 [private agents][6] and 1 [public agent][6].
*  [DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.9/cli/install/) installed.
*  The public IP address of your public agent node. After you have installed DC/OS with a public agent node declared, you can [navigate to the public IP address][9] of your public agent node.
*   Git:
    *   **macOS:** Get the installer from [Git downloads](http://git-scm.com/download/mac).
    *   **Unix/Linux:** See these [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

# Install the DC/OS services you'll need
From the DC/OS web interface [**Universe > Packages**](/docs/1.9/gui/#universe) tab, install Cassandra, Kafka, Marathon-LB, and Zeppelin.

__Tip:__ You can also install DC/OS packages from the DC/OS CLI with the [`dcos package install`][11] command.

1.  Find the **cassandra** package and click the **INSTALL PACKAGE** button and accept the default installation. Cassandra will spin up to at least 3 nodes. 
    ![Cassandra](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services1.png)
1.  Find the **kafka** package and click the **INSTALL PACKAGE** button and accept the default installation. Kafka will spin up 3 brokers.
    ![Kafka](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services2.png)
1.  Find the **marathon-lb** package and click the **INSTALL PACKAGE** button and accept the default installation.
    ![Marathon-LB](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services9.png)
1.  Install Zeppelin.
    1.  Find the **zeppelin** package and click the **INSTALL PACKAGE** button and choose the **ADVANCED INSTALLATION** option. 
        ![Zeppelin](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services3.png)    
    1.  Click the **spark** tab and set `cores_max` to `8`. 
        ![Zeppelin](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services4.png)
    1.  Click **REVIEW AND INSTALL** and complete your installation.
1.  Monitor the **Services** tab to watch as your microservices are deployed on DC/OS. You will see the Health status go from Idle to Unhealthy, and finally to Healthy as the nodes come online. This may take several minutes.

    **Tip:** It can take up to 10 minutes for Cassandra to initialize with DC/OS because of race conditions.

# Deploy the containerized app

In this step you deploy the containerized Tweeter app to a public node.

1.  Navigate to the [Tweeter](https://github.com/mesosphere/tweeter/) GitHub repository and save the `/tweeter/tweeter.json` Marathon app definition file. 

1.  Add the `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` definition with the public IP address of your [public agent][9] node to your `tweeter.json` file. 

    **Important:** You must remove the leading `http://` and the trailing `/`. 
    
    ```json
    ...
      ],
      "labels": {
        "HAPROXY_GROUP": "external",
        "HAPROXY_0_VHOST": "<public-agent-IP>"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, a DC/OS cluster is running on AWS: 
    
    ```bash
    ...
      ],
      "labels": {
        "HAPROXY_GROUP": "external",
        "HAPROXY_0_VHOST": "joel-ent-publicsl-e7wjol669l9f-741498241.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }
    ```

4.  Install and deploy Tweeter to your DC/OS cluster with this CLI command. 
    
    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add tweeter.json
    ```
    
    **Tip:** The `instances` parameter in `tweeter.json` specifies the number of app instances. Use the following command to scale your app up or down:
    
    ```bash
    dcos marathon app update tweeter instances=<number_of_desired_instances>
    ```

    The service talks to Cassandra via `node-0.cassandra.mesos:9042`, and Kafka via `broker-0.kafka.mesos:9557` in this example. Traffic is routed via Marathon-LB because of the `HAPROXY_0_VHOST` definition in the `tweeter.json` app definition file.

1.  Go to the **Services** tab to verify your app is up and healthy. 

    ![Tweeter deployed](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services7.png)

1.  Navigate to [public agent][9] node endpoint to see the Tweeter UI and post a tweet!

    ![Tweeter][14]

# Post 100K Tweets

Deploy the post-tweets containerized app to see DC/OS load balancing in action. This app automatically posts a large number of tweets from Shakespeare. The app will post more than 100k tweets one by one, so you'll see them coming in steadily when you refresh the page. 

1.  Navigate to the [Tweeter](https://github.com/mesosphere/tweeter/) GitHub repository and save the `tweeter/post-tweets.json` Marathon app definition file. 

1.  Deploy the `post-tweets.json` Marathon app definition file. 

    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add post-tweets.json
    ```
    
1.  After the `post-tweets.json` is running:
    
    *  Refresh your browser to see the incoming Shakespeare tweets.
    
       ![Shakespeare tweets](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-shakespeare.png)
       
    *  Click the **Networking** -> **Service Addresses** tab in the DC/OS web interface and select the `1.1.1.1:30000` virtual network to see the load balancing in action. 

       ![Tweeter scaled](/docs/1.9/img/tweeter-services8.png)

The post-tweets app works by streaming to the VIP `1.1.1.1:30000`. This address is declared in the `cmd` parameter of the `post-tweets.json` app definition.

```json
{
  "id": "/post-tweets",
  "cmd": "bin/tweet shakespeare-tweets.json http://1.1.1.1:30000",
...
```

The Tweeter app uses the service discovery and load balancer service that is installed on every DC/OS node. This address is defined in the `tweeter.json` definition `VIP_0`.

```bash
...
{
  "containerPort": 3000,
  "hostPort": 0,
  "servicePort": 10000,
  "labels": {
    "VIP_0": "1.1.1.1:30000"
...
```

# Add Streaming Analytics

Next, you'll perform real-time analytics on the stream of tweets coming in from Kafka.

1.  Navigate to Zeppelin at `https://<master_ip>/service/zeppelin/`, click **Import Note** and import `tweeter-analytics.json`. Zeppelin is preconfigured to execute Spark jobs on the DC/OS cluster, so there is no further configuration or setup required. Be sure to use `https://`, not `http://`.
    
    **Tip:** Your master IP address is the URL of the DC/OS web interface.

2.  Navigate to **Notebook** > **Tweeter Analytics**.

3.  Run the Load Dependencies step to load the required libraries into Zeppelin.

4.  Run the Spark Streaming step, which reads the tweet stream from ZooKeeper and puts them into a temporary table that can be queried using SparkSQL. 

5.  Run the Top Tweeters SQL query, which counts the number of tweets per user using the table created in the previous step. The table updates continuously as new tweets come in, so re-running the query will produce a different result every time.
