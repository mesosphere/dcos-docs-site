You can install DC/OS services by using the Package Management API. DC/OS services are installed from packages that are stored in a package registry, such as the [Mesosphere Universe](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesosphere-universe).

The [DC/OS Package Manager (Cosmos) component](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/#dcos-package-manager) runs on all master nodes.

For information about managing package repositories, see [Managing Package Repositories](/docs/1.9/administering-clusters/repo/).

For information about managing services, see [Managing Services](/docs/1.9/deploying-services/).


## Routes

| Route | Resource |
|-------|----------|
| `/cosmos/service/` | `/service/` |
| `/package/` | `/package/` |
| `/capabilities` | `/capabilities` |

## Authentication (Enterprise Only)

Enterprise edition users must authenticate Package Management API requests.

To authenticate API requests, see [Obtaining an authentication token](/docs/1.9/security/ent/iam-api/#obtaining-an-authentication-token) and [Passing an authentication token](/docs/1.9/security/ent/iam-api/#passing-an-authentication-token).

The Package Management API also requires authorization via the following permissions:

| Route | Permission |
|-------|----------|
| `/cosmos/service/` | `dcos:adminrouter:package` |
| `/package/` | `dcos:adminrouter:package` |
| `/capabilities` | `dcos:adminrouter:capabilities` |

All routes may also be reached by users with the `dcos:superuser` permission.

To assign permissions to your account, see [Assigning permissions](/docs/1.9/security/ent/perms-reference/).
