# About permissions

The permissions of Enterprise DC/OS allow you to control access by resource and sometimes by operation (create, read, update, delete). The number of permissions enforced increases as you move from `disabled` to `permissive` and from `permissive` to `strict` [security modes](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/ent/custom/configuration-parameters/#security). `permissive` security mode provides finer-grained controls and `strict` security mode provides the finest-grained controls. See the following table for details.

Permissions can be applied to users and groups using either the DC/OS web interface or the [IAM API](/docs/1.8/administration/id-and-access-mgt/iam-api/).
