# About provisioning Marathon-LB with a service account

Whether you can or must provision Marathon-LB with a service account varies by [security mode](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/ent/custom/configuration-parameters/#security).

- `disabled`: optional
- `permissive`: optional
- `strict`: required

To increase the security of your cluster and conform to the principle of least privilege, we recommend provisioning Marathon-LB with a service account in `permissive` mode. Otherwise, Marathon-LB will use the default `dcos_anonymous` account to authenticate and the `dcos_anonymous` account has the `superuser` permission.

In addition, if you plan to upgrade to `strict` mode, provisioning Marathon-LB with a service account in `disabled` and `permissive` modes will make the upgrade easier.

If you set up multiple Marathon-LB instances that interact with the same Marathon instance, you can use the same service account for each Marathon-LB instance.

This topic describes how to provision a Marathon-LB instance that interacts with the native Marathon instance.

To set up a service account for Marathon-LB, complete the following steps.

1. [Create a key pair.](#create-a-keypair)
1. [Create a service account.](#create-a-service-account)
1. [Create a service account secret.](#create-an-sa-secret)
1. [Provision the service account with the necessary permissions.](#give-perms)
1. [Create a config.json file.](#create-json)

**Requirement:** In `strict` mode, the name of the service account must match the name that the service uses as its `principal`. By default, Marathon-LB uses `mlb-principal` as the name of its `principal`. That's the value that we use in the following procedures. Should you modify the default, you must change `mlb-principal` throughout to match.

**Note:** We will use `mlb-secret` as the name of the secret, `mlb-private-key.pem` as the name of the file containing the private key, and `mlb-public-key.pem` as the name of the file containing the public key. We recommend sticking to these names as it will make it easier to copy and paste the commands. If you do decide to change the names, make sure to modify the commands before issuing them.

**Important:** We store the secret in the `marathon-lb` path. This protects it from other services, so we do not recommend changing this.

# <a name="create-a-keypair"></a>Create a key pair

First, you'll need to generate a 2048-bit RSA public-private key pair. While you can use any tool to accomplish this, the Enterprise DC/OS CLI is the most convenient because it returns the keys in the format needed by DC/OS.

**Prerequisite:** You must have the [DC/OS CLI installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/install/) and the [Enterprise DC/OS CLI 0.4.14 or later installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/enterprise-cli/#ent-cli-install).

1.  Use the following command to create a public-private key pair and save each value into a separate file within the current directory.

    ```bash
    dcos security org service-accounts keypair mlb-private-key.pem mlb-public-key.pem
    ```

1. Type `ls` to view the two new files created by the command. You may also want to open the files themselves and verify their contents.

1. Continue to the [next section](#create-a-service-account).

# <a name="create-a-service-account"></a>Create a service account

## About creating a service account

Next, you must create a service account. This section describes how to use either the Enterprise DC/OS CLI or the web interface to accomplish this.

## Using the Enterprise DC/OS CLI

**Prerequisite:** You must have the [DC/OS CLI installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/install/), the [Enterprise DC/OS CLI 0.4.14 or later installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/enterprise-cli/#ent-cli-install), and be logged in as a superuser via `dcos auth login`.

1. Use the following command to create a new service account called `mlb-principal` containing the public key you just generated.

    ```bash
    dcos security org service-accounts create -p mlb-public-key.pem -d "Marathon-LB service account" mlb-principal
    ```

1. Verify your new service account using the following command.

    ```bash
    dcos security org service-accounts show mlb-principal
    ```

1. Continue to [Create a service account secret](#create-an-sa-secret).

## Using the web interface

1. In the DC/OS web interface, navigate to the **System** -> **Organization** -> **Service Accounts** tab.

1. Click **New Service Account**.

1. Enter a description, the service account ID, and the public key associated with the account. Simply copy the contents of the relevant public key file into the **Public Key** field.

1. Continue to [Create a service account secret](#create-an-sa-secret).

# <a name="create-an-sa-secret"></a>Create a service account secret

## About creating a service account secret

Next, you need to create a secret associated with the service account that contains the private key. This section describes how to use either the Enterprise DC/OS CLI or the web interface to accomplish this.

## Using the Enterprise DC/OS CLI

**Prerequisite:** You must have the [DC/OS CLI installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/install/), the [Enterprise DC/OS CLI 0.4.14 or later installed](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/enterprise-cli/#ent-cli-install), and be logged in as a superuser via `dcos auth login`.

1. Depending on your security mode, use one of the following commands to create a new secret called `mlb-secret` in the `marathon-lb` path. Locating the secret inside the `marathon-lb` path will ensure that only the Marathon-LB service can access it. The secret will contain the private key, the name of the service account, and other data.

    **strict or permissive:**

    ```bash
    dcos security secrets create-sa-secret --strict mlb-private-key.pem mlb-principal marathon-lb/mlb-secret
    ```

    **disabled:**

    ```bash
    dcos security secrets create-sa-secret mlb-private-key.pem mlb-principal marathon-lb/mlb-secret
    ```

1. Ensure the secret was created successfully:

    ```bash
    dcos security secrets list /
    ```

1. If you have [jq 1.5 or later](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download) installed, you can also use the following command to retrieve the secret and ensure that it contains the correct service account ID and private key.

    ```bash
    dcos security secrets get /marathon-lb/mlb-secret --json | jq -r .value | jq
    ```

   **Important:** While reviewing the secret, ensure that the `login_endpoint` URL uses HTTPS if you're in `strict` or `permissive` mode and HTTP if you are in `disabled` mode. If the URL begins with `https` and you are in `disabled` mode, try [upgrading the Enterprise DC/OS CLI](/docs/1.8/usage/cli/enterprise-cli/#ent-cli-upgrade), deleting the secret, and recreating it.

1. Now that you have stored the private key in the Secret Store, we recommend deleting the private key file from your file system. This will prevent bad actors from using the private key to authenticate to DC/OS.

   ```bash
   rm -rf mlb-private-key.pem
   ```

1. Continue to [Provision the service account with permissions](#give-perms).

## Using the web interface

1. Log into the DC/OS web interface as a user with the `dcos:superuser` permission.

1. Open the **System** -> **Security** tab.

1. Click **New Secret**.

1. Type `marathon-lb/mlb-secret` into the **ID** field to create a new secret called `mlb-secret` in the `marathon-lb` path. Locating the secret inside the `marathon-lb` path will ensure that only the Marathon-LB service can access it.

1. If you have a `strict` or `permissive` cluster, paste the following JSON into the **Value** field.

  ```json
  {
      "scheme": "RS256",
      "uid": "mlb-principal",
      "private_key": "<private-key-value>",
      "login_endpoint": "https://master.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login"
  }
  ```

  If you have a `disabled` cluster, paste the following JSON into the **Value** field.

  ```json
  {
      "scheme": "RS256",
      "uid": "mlb-principal",
      "private_key": "<private-key-value>",
      "login_endpoint": "http://master.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login"
  }
  ```

  **Note:** In versions of Marathon-LB prior to 1.3.4, it was necessary to double-base64-encode the private key. Although the private key was already in the PEM format and thus already base64-encoded, you needed to base64-encode it again. This is no longer necessary. In fact, as of Marathon-LB 1.3.4, a double-base64-encoded private key causes a traceback error. Please note that if you follow the instructions in this section and use the DC/OS Enterprise CLI to create the private key as described, you will not end up with a double-base64-encoded private key, nor will you run into this issue.

1. Replace `<private-key-value>` with the value of the private key created in [Create a key pair](#create-a-keypair).

1. Click **Create**. Your secret has been stored!

   **Tip:** Be sure to copy the path to your secret into a text editor. You will need this later.

1. Continue to the [next section](#give-perms).

# <a name="give-perms"></a>Provision the service account with permissions

With the following curl commands you can rapidly provision the Marathon-LB service account with the required permissions. These commands can be executed from outside of the cluster. All you will need is the DC/OS CLI installed. You must also log in via `dcos auth login` as a superuser.

**Prerequisite:** If your [security mode](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/ent/custom/configuration-parameters/#security) is `permissive` or `strict`, you must follow the steps in [Obtaining and passing the DC/OS certificate in curl requests](/docs/1.8/administration/tls-ssl/get-cert/) before issuing the curl commands in this section. If your [security mode](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/ent/custom/configuration-parameters/#security) is `disabled`, you must delete `--cacert dcos-ca.crt` from the commands before issuing them.

1. Create the necessary permissions using the following commands.

   **Note:** There is always a chance that the permission has already been added. If so, the API returns an informative message. Consider this a confirmation and continue to the next one.

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT --cacert dcos-ca.crt -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/acs/api/v1/acls/dcos:service:marathon:marathon:services:%252F -d '{"description":"Allows access to any service launched by the native Marathon instance"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   curl -X PUT --cacert dcos-ca.crt -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/acs/api/v1/acls/dcos:service:marathon:marathon:admin:events -d '{"description":"Allows access to Marathon events"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   ```

1. Grant the permissions and the allowed action to the service account using the following commands.


   ```bash
   curl -X PUT --cacert dcos-ca.crt -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/acs/api/v1/acls/dcos:service:marathon:marathon:services:%252F/users/mlb-principal/read
   curl -X PUT --cacert dcos-ca.crt -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/acs/api/v1/acls/dcos:service:marathon:marathon:admin:events/users/mlb-principal/read
   ```

1. Continue to the [next section](#create-json).

# <a name="create-json"></a>Create a config.json file

## About the config.json file

The necessary contents of the `config.json` file vary according to your [security mode](/docs/1.8/administration/installing/ent/custom/configuration-parameters/#security).

## Strict and permissive mode config.json

If you have called the secret `mlb-secret`, you can copy and paste the following JSON into a new file and save it with the name `config.json`. Otherwise, change the name `mlb-secret` as needed.

```json
{
    "marathon-lb": {
        "secret_name": "marathon-lb/mlb-secret",
        "marathon-uri": "https://marathon.mesos:8443"
    }
}
```

**Note:** While switching the port used to communicate with Marathon to `8443` is not required to install Marathon-LB in `permissive` mode, we do recommend it. This ensures that Marathon-LB's communications with Marathon occur over an encrypted channel.

Continue to [Install Marathon-LB](#install-mlb).

## Disabled mode config.json

If you have called the secret `marathon-lb/mlb-secret`, you can copy and paste the following JSON into a new file and save it with the name `config.json`. Otherwise, change the name `marathon-lb/mlb-secret` as needed.

```json
{
    "marathon-lb": {
        "secret_name": "marathon-lb/mlb-secret"
    }
}
```

Continue to the [next section](#install-mlb).

## <a name="install-mlb"></a>Install Marathon-LB

To install the service, use the following command.

```bash
dcos package install --options=config.json marathon-lb
```

You can also provide the `config.json` file to someone else to install Marathon-LB. Please see the [Marathon-LB documentation](/docs/1.8/usage/service-discovery/marathon-lb/usage-ee/) for more information.
