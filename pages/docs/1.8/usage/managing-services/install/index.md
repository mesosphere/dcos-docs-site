## Installing a service using the CLI

The general syntax for installing a service with the CLI follows. 

```bash
dcos package install [--options=<config-file-name>.json] <servicename>
```

Use the optional `--options` flag to specify the name of the customized JSON file you created in [advanced configuration](/docs/1.8/usage/managing-services/config-universe-service/).

For example, you would use the following command to install Chronos with the default parameters.
    
```bash
dcos package install chronos
```
    
## Installing a service using the UI

From the DC/OS UI you can install services from the **Services** or **Universe** tab. The Universe tab shows all of the available DC/OS services from package [repositories](/docs/1.8/usage/repo/). The Services tab provides a full featured interface to the native DC/OS Marathon instance.


### Universe tab

1.  Navigate to the [**Universe**](/docs/1.8/usage/webinterface/#universe) page in the DC/OS UI.

2.  Choose your package and click **Install package**. 

3.  Confirm your installation or choose [**Advanced Installation**](/docs/1.8/usage/managing-services/config-universe-service/) to include a custom configuration.

### Services tab

1.  Navigate to the [**Services**](/docs/1.8/usage/webinterface/#services) tab in the DC/OS UI.
1.  Click **Deploy Service** and specify your Marathon app definition.
1.  Click **Deploy**. 

## Verifying your installation

### CLI

```bash
dcos package list
```

### Web UI

Go to the **Services** tab and confirm that the service is running. For more information, see the UI [documentation](/docs/1.8/usage/webinterface/#services).

**Tip:** Some services from the "Community Packages" section of the Universe will not show up in the DC/OS service listing. For these, inspect the service's Marathon app in the Marathon UI to verify that the service is running and healthy.
