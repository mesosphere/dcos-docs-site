DC/OS can be installed on any cluster of physical or virtual machines.

# [Local Installation][1]

For first-time users or developers looking to build services or modify DC/OS, the [Vagrant installer][1] provides a quick, free way to deploy a virtual cluster on a single machine.

# [Cloud Provisioning][6]

For users deploying to the public cloud, DC/OS offers configurable cloud provisioning templates for [AWS][2] and [Azure][3] that will manage virtual machines and DC/OS installation.

DC/OS can be installed on other public and private clouds using the Datacenter Installation process, provided virtual machines and networks are created first.

# [Custom Installation][7]

For new users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises or in the cloud, the [GUI Installer][4] provides a guided experience for bootstrapping a DC/OS cluster.

For advanced users installing to existing virtual or physical machines, on-premises or in the cloud, the [Advanced Installer][5] provides a scriptable, automatable interface to integrate with your preferred configuration management system.
