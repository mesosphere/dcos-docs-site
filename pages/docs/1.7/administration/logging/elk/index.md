You can pipe system and application logs from a DC/OS cluster to your existing ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) server.

**Prerequisites**

These instructions are based on CoreOS 766.4.0 and might differ substantially from other Linux distributions. This document does not explain how to setup and configure an ELK server.

*   A recent ELK stack with an HTTPS interface and certificate.
*   All DC/OS nodes must be able to connect to your ELK server via HTTPS.
*   The `ulimit` of open files must be set to `unlimited` for your user with root access.

# <a name="all"></a>Step 1: All Nodes

For all nodes in your DC/OS cluster:

1.  Install Elastic's [logstash-forwarder][2]. The project is written in Go and is compiled for most platforms.
2.  Download the HTTPS certificate for your ELK stash. In our examples, we assume the certificate is named `elk.crt`.

# <a name="master"></a>Step 2: Master Nodes

For each Master node in your DC/OS cluster:

1.  Create a `logstash.conf` configuration file for `logstash-forwarder` that sends `stdin` data directly to your ELK server.

        {
            "network": {
                    "servers": [ "<elk-hostname>:<elk-port>" ],
                    "timeout": 15,
                    "ssl ca": "elk.crt"
            },
            "files": [
                {
                    "paths": [ "-" ]
                }
            ]
        }

2.  Create a `logstash.sh` bash script to pipe DC/OS service logs from `journalctl` to `logstash-forwarder`.

            #!/bin/bash

            journalctl --since="now" -f             \
                -u dcos-adminrouter-reload.service  \
                -u dcos-adminrouter.service         \
                -u dcos-cluster-id.service          \
                -u dcos-cosmos.service              \
                -u dcos-ddt.service                 \
                -u dcos-epmd.service                \
                -u dcos-exhibitor.service           \
                -u dcos-gen-resolvconf.service      \
                -u dcos-history.service             \
                -u dcos-logrotate.service           \
                -u dcos-marathon.service            \
                -u dcos-mesos-dns.service           \
                -u dcos-mesos-master.service        \
                -u dcos-minuteman.service           \
                -u dcos-oauth.service               \
                -u dcos-signal.service              \
                -u dcos-spartan.service             \
                -u dcos-spartan-watchdog.service    \
                | ./logstash-forwarder -config logstash.conf

3.  Run `logstash.sh` as a service.

    **Important:** If any of these DC/OS services are restarted, you must restart this script.

# <a name="agent"></a>Step 3: Agent Nodes

For each Agent node in your DC/OS cluster:

1.  Create a `logstash.conf` configuration file for `logstash-forwarder` that sends `stdin` data directly to your ELK server.

        {
            "network": {
                "servers": [ "<elk-hostname>:<elk-port>" ],
                "timeout": 15,
                "ssl ca": "elk.crt"
            },
            "files": [
                {
                    "paths": [
                        "-",
                        "/var/lib/mesos/slave/slaves/*/frameworks/*/executors/*/runs/latest/stdout",
                        "/var/lib/mesos/slave/slaves/*/frameworks/*/executors/*/runs/latest/stderr"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }

2.  Create a `logstash.sh` bash script to pipe DC/OS service logs from `journalctl` to `logstash-forwarder`.

            #!/bin/bash

            journalctl --since="now" -f                 \
                -u dcos-ddt.service                     \
                -u dcos-epmd.service                    \
                -u dcos-gen-resolvconf.service          \
                -u dcos-logrotate.service               \
                -u dcos-mesos-slave.service             \
                -u dcos-mesos-slave-public.service      \
                -u dcos-minuteman.service               \
                -u dcos-spartan.service                 \
                -u dcos-spartan-watchdog.service        \
                -u dcos-vol-discovery-priv-agent.service\
                | ./logstash-forwarder -config logstash.conf

3.  Run `logstash.sh` as a service.

    **Important:** If any of these DC/OS services are restarted, you must restart this script.

### Known Issue

*   The agent node logstash configuration expects tasks to write logs to `stdout` and `stderr`. Some DC/OS services, including Cassandra and Kafka, do not write logs to `stdout` and `stderr`. If you want to log these services, you must customize your agent node logstash configuration.
