## About uninstalling services

Services can be uninstalled from either the web interface or the CLI. If the service has any reserved resources, you also need to run the framework cleaner script. The framework cleaner script removes the service instance from ZooKeeper, along with any data associated with it.  

## Uninstalling a service

### Uninstalling a service using the CLI

Uninstall a datacenter service with this command:

```bash
dcos package uninstall <servicename>
```

For example, to uninstall Chronos:

```bash
dcos package uninstall chronos
```

### Uninstalling a service using the web UI

1.  Navigate to the **Universe** page in the DC/OS [UI](/docs/1.7/usage/webinterface/#universe).

2.  Click on the **Installed** tab to see your installed services.

3.  Hover your cursor over the name of the package you wish to uninstall and you will see a red "Uninstall" link to the right. Click this link to uninstall the package.

### Troubleshooting

It's possible for an uninstall to fail with the following error message:

```
Incomplete uninstall of package [chronos] due to Mesos unavailability
```

The service may be inactive and will not be shown in the DC/OS UI, but you can find it by using this CLI command:

```bash
dcos service --inactive
NAME          HOST     ACTIVE  TASKS  CPU  MEM  DISK  ID
chronos    10.0.6.138  False     0    0.0  0.0  0.0   7c0a7bd4-3649-4ec1-866c-5db8f2292bf2-0001
```

You can complete the uninstall by shutting down the service by using this CLI command with the service ID specified, and then run the [framework cleaner](#framework-cleaner):

```bash
dcos service shutdown 7c0a7bd4-3649-4ec1-866c-5db8f2292bf2-0001
```

## <a name="framework-cleaner"></a>Cleaning up ZooKeeper

### About cleaning up ZooKeeper

If your service has reserved resources, you can use the framework cleaner docker image, `mesosphere/janitor`, to simplify the process of removing your service instance from ZooKeeper and destroying all the data associated with it.

There are two ways to run the framework cleaner script. The preferred method is via the DC/OS CLI. If the CLI is unavailable, you can also run the image as a self-deleting Marathon task.

### Configuring the cleanup

The script takes the following flags:

* `-r`: The role of the resources to be deleted
* `-p`: The principal of the resources to be deleted
* `-z`: The configuration zookeeper node to be deleted

These are some examples of default configurations (these will vary depending on selected task name, etc):

* Cassandra:
    * Default: `-r cassandra-role -p cassandra-principal -z cassandra`
    * Custom name: `-r <name>-role -p <name>-principal -z <name>`
* Kafka:
    * Default: `-r kafka-role -p kafka-principal -z kafka`
    * Custom name: `-r <name>-role -p <name>-principal -z <name>`

### Running from the DC/OS CLI

Connect to the leader and start the script:

1. Open an SSH session to the cluster leader.

        your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader

1. Run the `mesosphere/janitor` image with the role, principal, and zookeeper nodes that were configured for your service:

        leader$ docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r sample-role -p sample-principal -z sample-zk

### Running from Marathon

From the Marathon web interface, use the JSON editor to add the following as a Marathon task. Replace the values passed to `-r`/`-p`/`-z` according to what needs to be cleaned up.

    {
      "id": "janitor",
      "cmd": "/janitor.py -r sample-role -p sample-principal -z sample",
      "cpus": 1,
      "mem": 128,
      "disk": 1,
      "instances": 1,
      "container": {
        "docker": {
          "image": "mesosphere/janitor:latest",
          "network": "HOST"
        },
        "type": "DOCKER"
      }
    }
    
When the framework cleaner has completed its work, it will automatically remove itself from Marathon to ensure that it's only run once. This removal will often result in a `TASK_KILLED` or even a `TASK_FAILED` outcome for the janitor task, even if it finished successfully. The janitor task will also quickly disappear from both the Marathon web interface and the Dashboard.

### Verifying the outcome

To view the script's outcome, go to Mesos (`http://your-cluster.com/mesos`) and look at the task's `stdout` content. If `stdout` lacks content, run the following command manually:

    # Determine id of agent which ran the Docker task. This is an example:
    
    your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --mesos-id=c62affd0-ce56-413b-85e7-32e510a7e131-S3
    
    agent-node$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND             ...
    828ee17b5fd3        mesosphere/janitor:latest   /bin/sh -c /janito  ...
    
    agent-node$ docker logs 828ee17b5fd3
    
### Sample result

Here's an example of the output for a successful run for a Cassandra installation:

    your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader

    leader-node$ docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r cassandra_role -p cassandra_principal -z cassandra
    [... docker download ...]
    Master: http://leader.mesos:5050/master/ Exhibitor: http://leader.mesos:8181/ Role: cassandra_role Principal: cassandra_principal ZK Path: cassandra
