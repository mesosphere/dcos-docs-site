This section describes the developer-specific DC/OS components, explaining what is necessary to package and provide your own service on DC/OS.

The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS) provides the optimal user experience possible for orchestrating and managing a datacenter. If you are an Apache Mesos developer, you are already familiar with developing a framework. DC/OS extends Apache Mesos by including a web interface for health checks and monitoring, a command-line, a service packaging description, and a [repository][1] that catalogs those packages.
