excerpt: Configuring your DC/OS using advanced configuration methods
---

This page displays the topics for advanced configuration methods.

The DC/OS configuration parameters are specified in YAML format in a `config.yaml` file. This file is stored on your [bootstrap node](/1.10/installing/production/system-requirements/#bootstrap-node) and is used during DC/OS installation to generate a customized DC/OS build.

**Caution:** If you want to modify the configuration file after installation, you must follow the [DC/OS upgrade process](/1.10/installing/production/upgrading/).
