You can reset an existing user or create a new user with the DC/OS reset superuser script. This is helpful if the superuser account becomes locked or invalid. 

**Prerequisite:** You must have SSH access to the DC/OS cluster.

1.  [SSH](/1.10/administering-clusters/sshcluster/) to the master node using the method of your choice.

    For example:

    ```bash
    dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader
    ```
    
1.  Navigate to `/opt/mesosphere/active/bouncer/bouncer/bin/` and run the `reset-superuser` script with the username (`<username>`) specified.

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/mesosphere/bin/dcos-shell /opt/mesosphere/active/bouncer/bouncer/bin/reset-superuser <username>
    ```
    
1.  Enter the new password for the user and follow the prompts to complete the procedure.

    ```bash
    Type superuser password: 
    Retype superuser password: 
    ```
    
    For an existing user, the out should resemble:
    
    ```bash
