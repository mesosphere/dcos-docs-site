You can easily view and update the configuration of a deployed app by using the `dcos marathon` command.

**Note:** The process for updating packages from the [DC/OS Universe](/1.10/gui/catalog/) is different. For more information, see the [documentation](/1.10/deploying-services/config-universe-service/).

# Update an Environment Variable

Use the `dcos marathon app update` command from the DC/OS CLI to update any aspect of your service's JSON service definition. For instance, follow the instructions below to update the environment variable (`env` field) of the service definition.

A single element of the [`env` field][2] can be updated by specifying a JSON string in a command argument.

```bash
dcos marathon app update test-app env='{"APISERVER_PORT":"25502"}'
```

Now, run the command below to see the result of your update:

```bash
dcos marathon app show test-app | jq '.env'
```

# Update all Environment Variables

The entire [`env` field][1] can also be updated by specifying a JSON file in a command argument.

First, save the existing environment variables to a file:

```bash
dcos marathon app show test-app | jq .env >env_vars.json
```

The file will contain the JSON for the `env` field:

```json
{ "SCHEDULER_DRIVER_PORT": "25501", }
```

Now edit the `env_vars.json` file. Make the JSON a valid object by enclosing the file contents with `{ "env" :}` and add your update:

```json
{ "env" : { "APISERVER_PORT" : "25502", "SCHEDULER_DRIVER_PORT" : "25501" } }
```

Specify this CLI command with the JSON file specified:

```bash
dcos marathon app update test-app < env_vars.json
```

View the results of your update:

```bash
dcos marathon app show test-app | jq '.env'
```
