DC/OS provides a number of tools out-of-the-box, ranging from basic network connectivity between containers to more advanced features, such as load balancing and service discovery.

# IP Per Container
Allows containers to run on any type of IP-based virtual networks, with each container having its own network namespace.

DC/OS supports IP per container for the Universal container runtime (UCR) by using the Container network interface (CNI). DC/OS supports IP per container for the Docker container runtime by using the Container network model (CNM).

DC/OS provides an out-of-the box virtual networking solution for IP per container called DC/OS overlay that works both with UCR and Docker container runtimes. The DC/OS overlay uses the CNI/CNM support in Mesos to provide IP per container.For more information, see the [Containerizer documentation](/1.10/deploying-services/containerizers/).

# DNS-Based Service Discovery
DC/OS includes highly available, distributed, DNS-based service discovery. The service discovery mechanism in DC/OS contains these components:

- A centralized component called Mesos DNS, which runs on every master.
- A distributed component called Spartan that runs on every agent.

## Mesos DNS
Mesos DNS is a centralized, replicated, DNS server that runs on every master. Every task started by DC/OS gets a well-known DNS name. This provides a replicated highly available DNS service on each of the masters. Every instance of Mesos DNS polls the leading Mesos master and generates a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for every service running in DC/OS with the domain `*.mesos`.  For more information, see the [Mesos DNS documentation](/1.10/networking/mesos-dns/).

## DNS Forwarder (Spartan)
Spartan acts as a DNS masquerade for Mesos DNS on each agent.

The Spartan instance on each agent is configured to listen to three different local interfaces: `198.51.100.1`, `198.51.100.2`, and `198.51.100.3`. The `nameserver` option in the `/etc/resolv.conf` on the agent is set to these three interfaces.

This allows containers to perform up to three retries on a DNS request. To provide a highly available DNS service, Spartan forwards each request it receives to the different Mesos DNS instances which are running on each master.

- Scale-out DNS Server on DC/OS masters with replication.
- DNS server Proxy with links to all Active/Active DNS server daemons.
- DNS server cache service for local services.

The Spartan instance on each agent also acts as a DNS server for any service that is load balanced using the DC/OS internal load balancer called [Minuteman](/1.10/networking/load-balancing-vips/). Any service that is load balanced by Minuteman gets a [virtual-ip-address (VIP)](/1.10/networking/mesos-dns/) and an FQDN in the `"*.l4lb.thisdcos.directory"` domain. The FQDN allocated to a load-balanced service is then stored in Spartan. All Spartans instances exchange the records they have discovered locally from Minuteman by using GOSSIP. This provides a highly available distributed DNS service for any task that is load balanced by Minuteman. For more information, see the [Spartan repository](https://github.com/dcos/spartan).

# Load Balancing

DC/OS offers one load balancing option out-of-the-box: [Minuteman](/1.10/networking/load-balancing-vips/).

Two other load balancers, [Edge-LB](/services/edge-lb/latest/) and [Marathon-LB](/services/marathon-lb/1.12/) can be installed as services from the DC/OS Universe package repository.

| 0 hop load balancing               |     X     |         |             |
| No single point of failure         |     X     |         |             |

## Minuteman
Minuteman is a distributed layer 4 virtual IP east-west load balancer that is installed by default.
It's highly scalable and highly available, offering 0 hop load balancing, no single choke point,
and tolerance to host failures.


## Edge-LB
[Edge-LB](/services/edge-lb/latest/) builds upon HAProxy. HAProxy provides base functionality such as load balancing for TCP and HTTP-based applications, SSL support, and health checking. In addition, Edge-LB provides first class support for zero downtime service deployment strategies, such as blue/green deployment. Edge-LB subscribes to Mesos and updates HAProxy configuration in real time.

Edge-LB proxies and load balances traffic to all services that run on DC/OS. In contrast, Marathon-LB can only work with Marathon tasks. For example, if you are using Cassandra, Edge-LB can load balance the tasks launched by Cassandra.


## Marathon-LB
[Marathon-LB](/services/marathon-lb/1.12/) is based on HAProxy, a rapid proxy and north-south load balancer. HAProxy provides proxying and load balancing for TCP and HTTP based applications, with features such as SSL support, HTTP compression, health checking, Lua scripting and more. Marathon-LB subscribes to Marathonâ€™s event bus and updates the HAProxy configuration in real time.
