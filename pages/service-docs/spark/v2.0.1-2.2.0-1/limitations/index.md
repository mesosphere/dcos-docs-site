*   Mesosphere does not provide support for Spark app development, such as writing a Python app to process data from Kafka or writing Scala code to process data from HDFS.

*   Spark jobs run in Docker containers. The first time you run a Spark job on a node, it might take longer than you expect because of the `docker pull`.

*   DC/OS Apache Spark only supports running the Spark shell from within a DC/OS cluster. See the Spark Shell section for more information. For interactive analytics, we recommend Zeppelin, which supports visualizations and dynamic dependency management.
