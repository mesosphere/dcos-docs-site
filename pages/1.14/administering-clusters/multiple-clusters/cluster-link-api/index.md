# Routes

Access to the Cluster Link API is proxied through the Admin Router on each master node using the following route:

```

To determine the URL of your cluster, see [Cluster Access](/1.14/api/access/).

# Format

The Cluster Link API request and response bodies are formatted in JSON.

Requests must include the accept header:

```
Accept: application/json
```

Responses include the content type header:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

# Authentication

All Cluster Link API routes require authentication to use.

To authenticate API requests, see [Obtaining an authentication token](/1.14/security/ent/iam-api/#obtaining-an-authentication-token) and [Passing an authentication token](/1.14/security/ent/iam-api/#passing-an-authentication-token).

The Cluster Link API also requires authorization via the following permissions:

All routes can also be reached by users with the `dcos:superuser` permission.
