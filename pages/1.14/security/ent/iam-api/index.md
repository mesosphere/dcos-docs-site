The Identity and Access Management (IAM) API allows you to manage users, user groups, permissions, and LDAP configuration settings through a RESTful interface. It offers more functionality than the DC/OS UI.


# Request and response format

The API supports JSON only. You must include `application/json` as your `Content-Type` in the HTTP header, as shown below.

    Content-Type: application/json


# Host name and base path

The host name to use will vary depending on where your program is running.

* Use cluster URL, if your program runs outside of the DC/OS cluster. This can be obtained by launching the DC/OS UI and copying the domain name from the browser. Alternatively, you can log in to the DC/OS CLI and type `dcos config show core.dcos_url` to get the cluster URL. In a production environment, this should be the path to the load balancer which sits in front of your masters.

* Use `master.mesos`, if your program runs inside of the cluster.

Append `/acs/api/v1` to the host name, as shown below.

    https://<host-ip>/acs/api/v1


# Authentication and authorization

All IAM endpoints require an authentication token and the `dcos:superuser` permission---except the `auth` endpoints. The `auth` endpoints do not require authentication tokens because their purpose is to return authentication tokens upon successful login.

## Obtaining an authentication token

### Using the IAM API

To get an authentication token, pass the credentials of a local user or service account in the body of a `POST` request to `/auth/login`.

To log in local user accounts supply `uid` and `password` in the request.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Read how to <a href="/1.13/security/ent/tls-ssl/ca-trust-curl/">establish trust in curl commands</a> with DC/OS.</p>


```bash
curl -i -X POST https://<host-ip>/acs/api/v1/auth/login -d '{"uid": "<uid>", "password": "<password>"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

To log in service accounts supply user ID and a service login token in the request. The service login token is a RFC 7519 JWT of type RS256. It must be constructed by combining the service account (`uid`) and an expiration time (`exp`) claim in the JWT format. The JWT requirements for a service login token are:

1. Header
```json
{
    "alg": "RS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
```

2. Payload
```json
{
    "uid": "<uid>",
    "exp": "<expiration_time>"
}
```

The provided information must then be encrypted using the service account's private key. This can be done manually using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) or programmatically with your favorite JWT library. The final encoding step should result in a `base64` encoded JWT which can be passed to the IAM.

```bash
curl -X POST https://<host-ip>/acs/api/v1/auth/login -d '{"uid": "<service-account-id>", "token": "<service-login-token>"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Both requests return a DC/OS authentication token as shown below.

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg"
}
```

The DC/OS authentication token is also a RFC 7519 JWT of type RS256.

### Using the DC/OS CLI

When you log in to the [DC/OS CLI](/1.14/cli/) using `dcos auth login`, it stores the authentication token value locally. You can reference this value as a variable in `curl` commands (discussed in the next section).

Alternatively, you can use the following command to get the authentication token value.

```bash
dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token
```

## Passing an authentication token

### Using the HTTP header

Copy the token value and pass it in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header, as shown below.

```http
Authorization: token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg
```

### Using `curl` as a string value

Using `curl`, for example, you would pass this value as follows.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg"
```

### Using `curl` as a DC/OS CLI variable

You can then reference this value in your `curl` commands, as shown below.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)"
```

## Refreshing the authentication token

Authentication tokens expire after five days, by default. If your program needs to run longer than five days, you will need a service account. See [provisioning custom services](/1.14/security/ent/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) for more information.

# Logging

While the API returns informative error messages, you may also find it useful to check the logs of the service. Refer to [Service and Task Logging](/1.14/monitoring/logging/) for instructions.
