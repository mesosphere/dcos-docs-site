# Types of packages

Mesosphere offers two kinds of service packages: Certified and Community.

## Certified packages

Certified packages are verified by Mesosphere to be interoperable with DC/OS.

Documentation supporting these certified packages can be found on the [DC/OS Service Docs page](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/).

## Community packages

Community packages have been contributed by Mesosphere partners and members of the open source community. They are not verified by Mesosphere to be interoperable with DC/OS. However, they offer many functions not available in the Certified {{ model.packageRepo }}. New packages are offered on a regular basis. Some of them have Mesosphere-specific documentation available on the [DC/OS Service Docs page](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/).

# Installing from the {{ model.packageRepo }}
