You can use the [marathon-lb-autoscale](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon-lb-autoscale) application to implement request rate-based autoscaling with Marathon. The marathon-lb-autoscale application works with any application that uses TCP traffic and can be routed through HAProxy.

`marathon-lb-autoscale` collects data from all HAProxy instances to determine the current RPS (requests per second) for your apps. The autoscale controller then attempts to maintain a defined target number of requests per second per service instance. `marathon-lb-autoscale` makes API calls to Marathon to scale the app.

For more information, see the [Marathon-LB Reference](/services/marathon-lb/1.13/mlb-reference/).
