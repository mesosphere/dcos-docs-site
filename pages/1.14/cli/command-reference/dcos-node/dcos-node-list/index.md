# Description

The `dcos node list` command displays a list of DC/OS master and agent nodes with identifying information, including:
- Hostname
- IP address
- Public IP address
- Unique identifier
- Node type
- Cluster region
- Availability zone      

You can use this command to look up the public agent IP address if DC/OS is deployed on a public cloud provider such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. If DC/OS is installed on an internal network (on-premise) or on a private cloud, nodes do not typically have separate public and private IP addresses. For nodes on an internal network or private cloud, the public IP address is most often the same as the IP address defined for the server in the DNS namespace.

In most cases, you can use this command to return both the private and public IP addresses for each node. You should keep in mind, however, that the public and private IP addresses returned might not be accurate if the Edge-LB pool uses virtual networks.

# Usage

```bash
dcos node list [OPTION]
```

# Options

| Name, shorthand |  Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `--field name`   |  Specifies the name of one or more additional fields you want to include in the output of the dcos node command. You can include this option multiple times to add multiple fields. |
| `--help, h`   |   Displays usage. |
| `--info`   |  Displays a short description of this subcommand. |
| `--json`   |    Displays JSON-formatted data. |
| `--version`   |  Displays version information. |

# Permissions

Running this command requires your service or user account to have the following administrative permissions:
<p>
<code>dcos:adminrouter:ops:mesos full<br>
dcos:adminrouter:ops:mesos-dns full</code>
</p>

If you don't have an account with at least these permissions, the command returns an error.

To use this command to return public-facing IP addresses, your service or user account must have the following administrative permission:
<p>
<code>dcos:adminrouter:ops:networking full</code>
</p>

If you run the `dcos node list` command without this permission, the command returns node information but does not include the Public IP address column in the output. For more information about setting and managing permissions, see [Permissions Management](/1.14/security/ent/perms-management/) and [Permissions Reference](/1.14/security/ent/perms-reference/).

# Example
To following example illustrates how you can use this command to find the public-facing IP address for nodes in a small cluster:
```bash
dcos node list

dcos node list 
    HOSTNAME         IP      PUBLIC IP(S)                     ID                          TYPE           REGION           ZONE       
  10.0.2.148     10.0.2.148                 69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde-S1  agent            aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a  
  10.0.4.118     10.0.4.118  52.34.156.169  69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde-S0  agent (public)   aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a  
  master.mesos.  10.0.7.51   54.202.215.97  69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde     master (leader)  aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a  
```

The following example illustrates adding port information to the output for the command:
```bash
dcos node list --field port

    HOSTNAME         IP      PUBLIC IP(S)                     ID                          TYPE           REGION           ZONE       PORT  
  10.0.2.148     10.0.2.148                 69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde-S1  agent            aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a  5051  
  10.0.4.118     10.0.4.118  52.34.156.169  69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde-S0  agent (public)   aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a  5051  
  master.mesos.  10.0.7.51   54.202.215.97  69e4f34a-e5c4-4271-85b5-b6609056bcde     master (leader)  aws/us-west-2  aws/us-west-2a        
```
