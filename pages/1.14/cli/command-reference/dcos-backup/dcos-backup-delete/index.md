# Example

See the documentation for [`dcos backup list`](/../dcos-backup/dcos-backup-list/) to get the backup ID.

1. Run the `dcos backup list` command to get a list of your backups.

    ```bash
    $ dcos backup list
    BACKUP ID                                         VERSION     STATUS           TIMESTAMP
    ---------                                         -------     ------           ---------
    backup-1-fd4bdc87-889c-48c3-a656-9f8e96474b27     1.13.0      STATUS_READY     2019-03-18 23:06:41.836197172 +0000 UTC
    backup2-c55c20e9-ba3f-46a6-b944-20a790b5491a      1.13.0      STATUS_READY     2019-03-18 23:15:47.639999548 +0000 UTC
    backup3-317c19df-34e4-41a0-93c9-d66c7f307208      1.13.0      STATUS_BACKING_UP     2019-03-18 23:16:33.265478871 +0000 UTC
    ```

1. Use the backup ID to delete the backup:

    ```
    dcos backup delete backup-1-fd4bdc87-889c-48c3-a656-9f8e96474b27
    ```

    The backup will be deleted but there will be no confirmation output.

1. However, if you run `dcos backup list` again, you will not see the backup listed, which indicates that it has been removed.

    ```bash
    dcos backup list
    BACKUP ID                                        VERSION     STATUS                TIMESTAMP
    ---------                                        -------     ------                ---------
    backup2-c55c20e9-ba3f-46a6-b944-20a790b5491a     1.13.0      STATUS_READY          2019-03-18 23:15:47.639999548 +0000 UTC
    backup3-317c19df-34e4-41a0-93c9-d66c7f307208     1.13.0      STATUS_BACKING_UP     2019-03-18 23:16:33.265478871 +0000 UTC
    ```
