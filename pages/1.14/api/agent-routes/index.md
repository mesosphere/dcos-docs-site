Admin Router Agent runs on DC/OS agent nodes. It exposes the following API routes.

-   Admin Router Agent listens on port `61001` (HTTP).

-   DC/OS Enterprise adds optional SSL encryption of component communication, in which case Admin Router Agent also listens on port `61002` (HTTPS).

For more detail about how API routing works, see [DC/OS API Reference](/1.14/api/).
