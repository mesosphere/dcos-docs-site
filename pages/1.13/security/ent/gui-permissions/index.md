By default, a [new user](/1.13/security/ent/users-groups/) has no permissions and cannot view the [DC/OS GUI](/1.13/gui/). You must grant users and groups access to each screen of the web interface.

**Important:** Only [superusers](/1.13/security/ent/perms-reference/#superuser) can view the Dashboard, Nodes, and **Cluster -> Overview** tabs.
