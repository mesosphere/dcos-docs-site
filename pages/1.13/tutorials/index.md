The tutorials in this section cover the following tasks:
- How to create a small cluster for demonstration and testing purposes.
- How to define and deploy sample services on the new cluster.
- How to customize your cluster configuration.

These tutorials guide you through the steps for setting up a cluster for testing or evaluation purposes. For a production environment or larger scale deployment, however, additional steps are typically required.
