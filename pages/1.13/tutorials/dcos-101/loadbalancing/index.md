Welcome to part 8 of the DC/OS 101 Tutorial.


# Prerequisites
* A [running DC/OS cluster](/tutorials/dcos-101/cli/) with [the DC/OS CLI installed](/cli/install/).
* [app2 and Marathon-LB](/tutorials/dcos-101/app2/) deployed and running in your cluster.

# Objective
In this session, you will scale your application to multiple instances and learn how internal and external services choose which instance to use once the application has been scaled.

# Steps
Load-balancers decide which instance of an app internal or external services should use. With DC/OS, you have two different built-in load-balancer options:

1. [Marathon-LB](/networking/marathon-lb/)
1. [Named VIPs](/networking/load-balancing-vips/).

You have already explored these load balancing mechanisms in the context of [service discovery](/tutorials/dcos-101/service-discovery/), and in a [previous](/tutorials/dcos-101/marathon-lb/) tutorial you used Marathon-LB to publicly expose app2. Now let's explore them a bit more.
* First, scale app2 to two instances:

  `dcos marathon app update /dcos-101/app2 instances=2`
* **Marathon-LB**
    * Check app2 as before via `http://<public-node>10000`. When you do this repeatedly you should see the request being served by different instances of app2.
    * You can also check the Marathon-LB stats via `http://<public-node>:9090/haproxy?stats`
* **Named VIPs**
    * SSH to the leading master node: `dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader`
    * Use curl to get the raw HTML output from the app:

      `curl dcos-101app2.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:10000`

      When you do this repeatedly you should see the request being served by different instances.
* Scale app2 back to one instance:

  `dcos marathon app update /dcos-101/app2 instances=1`

# Outcome
You used Marathon-LB and VIPs to load balance requests for two different instances of your app.

# Deep Dive
Consider these features and benefits when choosing the load balancing mechanism.

   * [Marathon-LB](/networking/marathon-lb/) is a layer 7 load balancer that is mostly used for external requests. It is based on the well-known HAProxy load balancer and uses Marathonâ€™s event bus to update its configuration in real time. Being a layer 7 load balancer, it supports session-based features such as HTTP sticky sessions and zero-downtime deployments.
   * [Named VIPs](/networking/load-balancing-vips/) are a layer 4 load balancer mechanism used for internal TCP traffic. As they are tightly integrated with the kernel, they provide a load balanced IP address which can be used from anywhere within the cluster.
