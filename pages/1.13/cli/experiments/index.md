The DC/OS CLI offers experimental features which are still in development and
may still contain bugs.

Experiments are activated by setting a certain environment variable.

# Reporting Issues #


If you encounter an issue with one of our experimental features, please [file a
ticket](https://jira.mesosphere.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=14105&issuetype=1&priority=3&customfield_12300=114&components=19801&description=Describe%20the%20issue%3A%0A%0AExperiments%20being%20used%3A%0A%0AReproduction%20steps%3A%0A%0AOutput%20when%20run%20with%20%60dcos%20-vv%60%3A%0A%0AOutput%20of%20%60dcos%20--version%60%3A
).

Make sure to set the component to `dcos-cli` and the team to `CLI Team`. In the
description, please include the experiments you have enabled and debug output
from the command using the `-vv` flag.

# Currently Active Experiments #

## Automatic Installation of Core and Enterprise CLI Plugins ##

Usage: `export DCOS_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL_AUTOINSTALL_PLUGINS=1`

When running `dcos cluster setup`, this experiment enables automatic
installation of the [Core and Enterprise CLI plugins](/1.13/cli/plugins/) from
Cosmos. There are Core CLI plugins available in Cosmos for DC/OS 1.10+.

For this to be successful, the user will need to have the
`dcos:adminrouter:package` permission in order to make calls to Cosmos. Also,
the system needs access to the internet or a [local universe](/1.13/administering-clusters/deploying-a-local-dcos-universe/).
