# Ensure your cloud provider credentials

There are many ways of passing in your credentials in order for Terraform to authenticate with your cloud provider. Most likely, you already have your cloud provider credentials loaded through the Azure CLI. Terraform will automatically detect those credentials during initialization for you. See [installing the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for more information. See the [Terraform Azure provider reference](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/auth/azure_cli.html) for more information on how this works under the hood.

Alternatively, it can be set through your terminal. You can set the default account with the following command:

```bash
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="desired-azure-id"
```

Ensure it is set:

```bash
echo $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Or, You can pass your Azure ID in as the `subscription_id` through the configuration file you will create. Please keep in mind storing your credentials outside of your version control for security.

```bash
provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```
