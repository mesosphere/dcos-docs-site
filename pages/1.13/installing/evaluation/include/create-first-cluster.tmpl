## Initialize terraform and create a cluster
1. Now the action of actually creating your cluster and installing DC/OS begins. First, initialize the project's local settings and data.  Make sure you are still working in the same folder where you created your `main.tf` file, and run the initialization.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

    ```text
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!

    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.

    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your environment. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
    ```

    <p class="message--note"><strong>Note: </strong>If terraform is not able to connect to your provider, ensure that you are logged in and are exporting your credentials and necessary region information for your cloud provider.</p>

2.  After Terraform has been initialized, the next step is to run the execution planner and save the plan to a static file - in this case, `plan.out`.

      ```bash
      terraform plan -out=plan.out
      ```

    Writing the execution plan to a file allows us to pass the execution plan to the `apply` command below as well help us guarantee the accuracy of the plan. Note that this file is ONLY readable by Terraform.

    Afterwards, we should see a message like the one below, confirming that we have successfully saved to the `plan.out` file.  This file should appear in your `dcos-aws-demo` folder alongside `main.tf`.

    <p align=center>
    <img src="./images/install/terraform-plan.png" />
    </p>

    Every time you run `terraform plan`, the output will always detail the resources your plan will be adding, changing or destroying.  Since we are creating our DC/OS cluster for the very first time, our output tells us that our plan will result in adding 38 pieces of infrastructure/resources.

3.  The next step is to get Terraform to build/deploy our plan.  Run the command below.

    ```bash
    terraform apply plan.out
    ```

  Sit back and enjoy! The infrastructure of your DC/OS cluster is being created while you watch. This may take a few minutes.

  Once Terraform has completed applying the plan, you should see output similar to the following:

  <p align=center>
  <img src="./images/install/terraform-apply.png" />
  </p>

  And congratulations - you’re up and running!
