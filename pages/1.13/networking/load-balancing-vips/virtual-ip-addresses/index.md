DC/OS can map traffic from a single Virtual IP (VIP) to multiple IP addresses and ports. DC/OS VIPs are **name-based**, which means clients connect with a service address instead of an IP address.

DC/OS automatically generates name-based VIPs that do not collide with IP VIPs, so you don’t have to worry about collisions. This feature allows name-based VIPs to be created automatically when the service is installed.

A named VIP contains these components:

 * Private virtual IP address
 * Port (a port on which the service is available)
 * Service name

You can assign a VIP to your application from the DC/OS GUI. The values you enter when you deploy a new service are translated into these Marathon application definition entries:

- `portDefininitions` if not using Docker containers
- `portMappings` if using Docker containers

VIPs follow this naming convention:

```
<service-name>.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:<port>
```

### Prerequisite

*   A pool of VIP addresses that are unique to your application.

## Creating a VIP

1.  From the DC/OS [GUI](/1.13/gui/), click on the **Services** tab, then on **RUN A SERVICE**.
    1.  From the **Networking** tab, select  **NETWORK TYPE** > **Virtual Network: dcos**.
    2.  Expand **ADD SERVICE ENDPOINT** and provide responses for:

        -  **CONTAINER PORT**
        -  **SERVICE ENDPOINT NAME**
        -  **PORT MAPPING**
        -  **LOAD BALANCED SERVICE ADDRESS**

        As you fill in these fields, the service addresses that Marathon sets up will appear at the bottom of the screen. You can assign multiple VIPs to your app by clicking **ADD SERVICE ENDPOINT**.

        Figure 1. VIP service definition screen

        In Figure 1, clients can access the service at `my-service.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:5555`.

    1.  Click **REVIEW & RUN** and **RUN SERVICE**.

You can click on the **Networking** tab to view networking details for your service.

For more information on port configuration, see the [Marathon ports documentation](/1.13/deploying-services/service-ports/).

## Using VIPs with DC/OS Services

Some DC/OS services, for example [Kafka](/services/kafka/), automatically create VIPs when you install them. The naming convention is: `broker.<service.name>.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9092`.

Follow these steps to view the VIP for Kafka.

### Via the GUI

1.  Click **Networking** > **Networks** and select **dcos**.
1.  Select your task to view details.

### Via the CLI

**Prerequisite:** The Kafka service and CLI must be [installed](/services/kafka/).

1.  Run this command:

    ```bash
    dcos kafka endpoints broker
    ```

    The output should resemble:

    ```json
    {
      "address": [
        "10.0.2.199:9918"
      ],
      "zookeeper": "master.mesos:2181/dcos-service-kafka",
      "dns": [
        "broker-0.kafka.mesos:9918"
      ],
      "vip": "broker.kafka.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9092"
    }
    ```
You can use this VIP to address any one of the Kafka brokers in the cluster.


## FAQs

### Connections seem to close at random times

This behavior is often experienced with applications that have long lived connections, such as databases (for example, PostgreSQL). To fix, try turning on keepalives. The keepalive can be an application specific mechanism like a heartbeat, or something in the protocol like a TCP keepalive. A keepalive is required because a load balancer cannot differentiate between idle or dead connections as no packets are sent in either case. The default timeout depends on the kernel configuration, but is usually 5 minutes.
