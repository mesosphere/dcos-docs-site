excerpt: Understanding DC/OS components

---

DC/OS is composed of many open source microservice components meticulously tuned and configured to work together. Mesosphere DC/OS Enterprise includes most of the open source DC/OS components but also includes several additional components, modules, and plugins.

Figure 1 - DC/OS components

From the top, DC/OS is an inclusive container platform that handles container orchestration, package management, and security. From the bottom, DC/OS is an operating system built on top of [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) that handles cluster management and software defined networking, while simplifying logging and metrics collection.

<a name="cluster-management"><a>
# Cluster management

DC/OS provides a way to view and operate a large number of individual machine-level systems as a single cluster-level system. It hides the complexity of Mesos, the distributed systems kernel, with higher level abstractions, interfaces, and tools. Cluster management is the core of that functionality, including the kernel, its dependencies, and its user interfaces.

<a name="apache-mesos"></a>
## Apache Mesos

Mesos manages resources and tasks as a distributed systems kernel. Mesos Master exposes scheduler, executor, and operator interfaces to facilitate cluster management. Mesos Agent manages individual executors, tasks, and resources on each [DC/OS agent node](/1.12/overview/concepts/#dcos-agent-node). Mesos Agent Public is a Mesos Agent configured to run on [DC/OS public agent nodes](/1.12/overview/concepts/#public-agent-node).

# Container orchestration

Container orchestration is the continuous, automated scheduling, coordination, and management of containerized processes and the resources they consume. DC/OS includes built-in orchestration of the most commonly used high level container-based abstractions: jobs and services. Many use cases are handled directly by these basic abstractions, but they also enable the deployment of custom schedulers for tasks that require more flexible programmatic lifecycle management automation.

No software runs perfectly, especially not the first time. Distributing tasks across a cluster, as well as the normal patterns of analyzing and debugging these services, become tedious. DC/OS includes several components to help ease the pain of debugging distributed systems by aggregating, caching, and streaming logs, metrics, and cluster state metadata.

# Networking

In a world where machines are given numbers instead of names, tasks are scheduled automatically, dependencies are declaratively defined, and services run in distributed sets, network administration also needs to be elevated from plugging in cables to configuring software-defined networks. To accomplish this, DC/OS includes a fleet of networking components for routing, proxying, name resolution, virtual IPs, load balancing, and distributed reconfiguration.

# Package management

Just as machine operating systems need package management to install, upgrade, configure, and remove individual applications and services, a datacenter operating system needs package management to do the same for distributed services. In DC/OS there are two levels of package management: machine-level for components; and cluster-level for user services.


<a name="dcos-package-manager"></a>

## DC/OS package manager (Cosmos)

# IAM and Security
[/enterprise]

Identity and access management in DC/OS Enterprise is governed by an internal database of users, user groups, and permissions. External identity providers can also be attached to take advantage of existing databases. Permissions are enforced both at the edge by Admin Router's reverse proxy and also at the component level for controlling access to specific actions. Secrets, like SSL certificates, can also be securely generated, managed, stored, and injected into user services.

<a name="dcos-iam"></a>

## DC/OS Identity and Access Manager (Bouncer)

DC/OS Identity and Access Manager (IAM) controls access to DC/OS components and services by managing users, user groups, service accounts, permissions, and identity providers. In addition to managing a local user database, DC/OS IAM can delegate to external identity providers using LDAP, SAML, or Open ID Connect. For fine grained access control, other DC/OS components, like Mesos and Marathon, integrate with DC/OS IAM directly. DC/OS IAM is also known as Bouncer.

### System service

- `dcos-bouncer.service`

# Sockets and timers

Several components are configured to use on-demand [systemd sockets](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html) which allows them to be started when a request comes in, rather than running continuously and consuming resources unnecessarily. While these sockets are separate [systemd units](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) they are not considered separate components.

Several components are configured to use [systemd timers](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html) which allows them to be periodically executed or restarted. Periodic execution avoids continuous execution and consuming resources unnecessarily. Periodic restarting allows for picking up new configurations from downstream dependencies, like time-based DNS cache expiration. While these timers are separate [systemd units](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) they are not considered separate components.

# Component installation

DC/OS components are installed, upgraded, and managed by [DC/OS Component Package Manager (Pkgpanda)](https://github.com/dcos/dcos/tree/master/pkgpanda), a package manager for `systemd` units.

To see the full list of packages managed by the DC/OS installer, see the [packages directory of the DC/OS source repository](https://github.com/dcos/dcos/tree/master/packages).

# `Systemd` services

Most DC/OS components run as [systemd services](/1.12/overview/concepts/#systemd-service) on the DC/OS nodes.

To see a list of the `systemd` components running on any particular node, list the contents of the `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants/` directory or execute `systemctl | grep dcos-` to see their current status.
