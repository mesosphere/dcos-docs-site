DC/OS uses Marathon to manage processes and services and is the "init system" for DC/OS. Marathon starts and monitors your applications and services, automatically healing failures.

A native Marathon instance is installed as a part of DC/OS installation. The Marathon web UI is accessible at `<dcos-url>`/marathon.
