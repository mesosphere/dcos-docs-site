[NGINX](https://www.nginx.com) is a high-performance HTTP server, reverse proxy, and an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. DC/OS allows you to quickly configure, install and manage NGINX.

**Terminology**

- **Docker**: Docker is a piece of software that helps package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

**Scope**

In this tutorial you will learn:
* How to install NGINX on DC/OS to serve a static website

## Table of Contents

## Prerequisites

- A running DC/OS cluster, with atleast 1 node having atleast 1 CPUs and 1 GB of RAM available.
- [DC/OS CLI](/1.7/usage/cli/install/) installed

## Installing NGINX to serve a static website

Assuming you have a DC/OS cluster up and running, we are going to install NGINX on DC/OS to serve up a [hello-nginx website](http://mesosphere.github.io/hello-nginx/). Let's get started by creating a file called `options.json` with following contents:

```json
{
  "nginx": {
    "cpus": 1,
    "mem": 1024,
    "bridge": true,
    "contentUrl":"https://github.com/mesosphere/hello-nginx/archive/master.zip",
    "contentDir":"hello-nginx-master/"
  }
}
```

Here's how the above `options.json` file configures our NGINX docker container:
* `cpus`: This parameter configures the number of CPU share to allocate to NGINX.
* `mem`: This parameter configures the amount of RAM to allocate to NGINX.
* `bridge`: This parameter configures whether the container should use `BRIDGE` mode networking or not. If this parameter is false, NGINX will be launched using `HOST` mode networking for docker. For more details, please refer to [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
* `contentUrl`: This parameter is the URL to a file archive of a static website that we would like to serve using NGINX.
* `contentDir`: This parameter is the name of the directory that gets created when the file specified using `contentUrl` is downloaded and uncompressed.

Next, we are going to install NGINX using this `options.json` file:

```bash
dcos package install nginx --options=options.json
```

Once you run above command, you'll see following output:

```bash
Preparing to install nginx.
Installing Marathon app for package [nginx] version [1.8.1]
Nginx is getting installed.
```

To verify that our NGINX instance is up and running, we can use `dcos task` command:

```bash
dcos task
NAME   HOST        USER  STATE  ID
nginx  10.0.0.161  root    R    nginx.b1e20ff3-0500-11e6-83da-8a8d57d7c81f
```

Let's try to access the hello-world website that our NGINX server is now hosting by opening following URL: `http://<YOUR-DCOS-MASTER-HOSTNAME>/service/nginx`. You should see a webpage similar to this:

![Hello World NGINX on DC/OS](img/hello-nginx-dcos.png)

## Uninstalling NGINX

To uninstall NGINX, run following command:

```bash
dcos package uninstall nginx
```
