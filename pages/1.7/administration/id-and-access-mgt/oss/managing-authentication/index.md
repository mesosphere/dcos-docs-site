Authentication is managed in the DC/OS web interface.

You can authorize individual users. You can grant access to users who are local or remote to your datacenter.

The DC/OS user database is persisted in ZooKeeper by running on the master nodes in [znodes](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_zkDataModel_znodes) under the path `/dcos/users`. Tokens that are sent to DC/OS in an HTTP Authorization header must be in this format: `token=<token>`. In future versions `Bearer <token>` will also be supported. 

## User management

Users are granted access to DC/OS by another authorized user. A default user is automatically created by the first user that logs in to the DC/OS cluster.

To manage users:

1.  Launch the DC/OS web interface and login with your username (Google, GitHub, and Microsoft) and password.

2.  Click on the **System** -> **Organization** tab and choose your action.

    ### Add users

    From the **Users** tab, click **New User** and fill in the new user email address. New users are automatically sent an email notifying them of access to DC/OS.

    **Tip:** Any user with access to DC/OS can invite more users. Each DC/OS user is an administrator, there is no explicit concept of privileges with DC/OS.

    ### Delete users

    1.  From the **Users** tab, select the user name and click **Delete**.
    2.  Click **Delete** to confirm the action.

    ### Switch users

    To switch users, you must log out of the current user and then back in as the new user.

    *   To log out of the DC/OS web interface, click on your username in the lower left corner and select **Sign Out**.

        ![log out](../img/auth-enable-logout-user.gif)

        You can now log in as another user.

    *   To log out of the DC/OS CLI, enter the command:

        ```bash
        dcos config unset core.dcos_acs_token
        Removed [core.dcos_acs_token]
        ```

        You can now log in as another user.

## <a name="log-in-cli"></a>Logging in to the DC/OS CLI

Authentication is only supported for DC/OS CLI version 0.4.3 and above. See [here](/1.7/usage/cli/update/) for upgrade instructions.

The DC/OS CLI stores the token in a configuration file in the `.dcos` directory under the home directory of the user running the CLI. This token can be used with the curl command to access DC/OS APIs, using curl or wget. For example, `curl -H 'Authorization: token=<token>' http://cluster`.

1.  Run this CLI command to authenticate to your cluster:

    ```bash
    dcos auth login
    ```

    Here is an example of the output:

    ```bash
    Please go to the following link in your browser:

        https://<public-master-ip>/login?redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob

    Enter authentication token:
    ```

1.  Paste the link from the CLI into your browser and sign in.

1.  Copy the authentication token from your browser.

    ![alt](../img/auth-login-token.gif)

1.  Paste the authentication token in to your terminal.

## Logging out of the DC/OS CLI

To logout, run this command:

```bash
dcos auth logout
```

## Debugging

To debug authentication problems, refer to the Admin Router and dcos-oauth logs on the masters, you can run:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u dcos-adminrouter.service
sudo journalctl -u dcos-oauth.service
```

## Authentication opt-out

If you are doing an [advanced installation](/1.7/administration/installing/oss/custom/advanced/), you can opt out of
Auth0-based authentication by adding this parameter to your configuration file (`genconf/config.yaml`). For more information, see the configuration [documentation](/1.7/administration/installing/oss/custom/configuration-parameters/).

```yaml
oauth_enabled: 'false'
```

If you are doing a cloud installation on [AWS](/1.7/administration/installing/oss/cloud/aws/), you can set the `OAuthEnabled` option to `false` on the **Specify Details** step to disable authentication.

If you are doing a cloud installation on [Azure](/1.7/administration/installing/oss/cloud/azure/), you currently cannot disable authentication. This will be added in a future release along with other
options to customize authentication.

Note that if you’ve already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in-place, you can go through an upgrade with the same parameter set.

## Ad Blockers and the DC/OS UI

During testing, we have observed issues with loading the DC/OS UI login page
when certain ad blockers such as HTTP Switchboard or Privacy Badger are active.
Other ad blockers like uBlock Origin are known to work.

## Future work

We are looking forward to working with the DC/OS community on improving existing
security features as well as on introducing new ones in the coming releases.
