The advanced AWS CloudFormation templates bring power and flexibility to creating and extending DC/OS clusters. With these templates you can choose from the complete set of DC/OS configuration options.
 
 - Instantiate a complete DC/OS cluster on an existing VPC/Subnet combination.
 - Extend and update existing DC/OS clusters by adding more [agent](/1.7/overview/concepts/#agent) nodes. 
 
The templates are used together in conjunction to create a DC/OS cluster. The templates are driven by parameters that AWS CloudFormation uses to create each stack.
