DC/OS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DC/OS build.

The DC/OS installation process requires a cluster of nodes to install DC/OS onto and a single node to run the DC/OS installation from.

Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.io> to obtain the DC/OS setup file.
