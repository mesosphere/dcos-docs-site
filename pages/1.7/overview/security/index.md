This topic discusses the security features in DC/OS and best practices for deploying DC/OS securely.

## General security concepts

DC/OS is based on a Linux kernel and userspace. The same best practices for securing any Linux system apply to securing DC/OS, including setting correct file permissions, restricting root and normal user accounts, protecting network interfaces with iptables or other firewalls, and regularly applying updates from the Linux distribution used with DC/OS to ensure that system libraries, utilities, and core services like systemd and OpenSSH are secure.

## Security Zones

At the highest level we can distinguish three security zones in a DC/OS deployment, namely the admin, private, and public security zones.

### Admin zone

The **admin** zone is accessible via HTTP/HTTPS and SSH connections, and provides access to the master nodes. It also provides reverse proxy access to the other nodes in the cluster via URL routing. For security, the DC/OS cloud template allows configuring a whitelist so that only specific IP address ranges are permitted to access the admin zone.

### Private zone

The **private** zone is a non-routable network that is only accessible from the admin zone or through the edge router from the public zone. Deployed services are run in the private zone. This zone is where the majority of agent nodes are run.

### Public zone

The optional **public** zone is where publicly accessible applications are run. Generally, only a small number of agent nodes are run in this zone. The edge router forwards traffic to applications running in the private zone.

The agent nodes in the public zone are labeled with a special role so that only specific tasks can be scheduled here. These agent nodes have both public and private IP addresses and only specific ports should be open in their iptables firewall.

### Typical AWS deployment

A typical AWS deployment including AWS Load Balancers is shown below:

## Admin Router

Access to the admin zone is controlled by the Admin Router.

HTTP requests incoming to your DC/OS cluster are proxied through the Admin Router (using [Nginx](http://nginx.org) with [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) at its core). The Admin Router denies access to most HTTP endpoints for unauthenticated requests. In order for a request to be authenticated, it needs to present a valid authentication token in its `Authorization` header. A token can be obtained by going through the authentication flow.

See the [Identity and Access Management](/1.7/administration/id-and-access-mgt/ent/) topic for more information.
