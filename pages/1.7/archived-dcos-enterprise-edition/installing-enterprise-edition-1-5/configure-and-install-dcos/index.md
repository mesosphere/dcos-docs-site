This topic provides instructions for installing DC/OS in your environment by using a customized Bash install script.

The DC/OS installation creates these folders:

*   `/opt/mesosphere`
    :   Contains all the DC/OS binaries, libraries, cluster configuration. Do not modify.

*   `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`
    :   Contains the systemd services which start the things that make up systemd. They must live outside of `/opt/mesosphere` because of systemd constraints.

*   Various units prefixed with `dcos` in `/etc/systemd/system`
    :   Copies of the units in `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`. They must be at the top folder as well as inside `dcos.target.wants`.

Choose your DC/OS installation method:

*   [Using SSH to distribute DC/OS across your nodes][1]
*   [Manually distributing DC/OS across your nodes][2]

# <a name="ssh"></a>Using SSH to distribute DC/OS across your nodes

**Prerequisite:** If your SSH key has a passphrase, you must decrypt your SSH key before installing DC/OS. For information on how to decrypt your SSH key, see [these instructions][3].

### <a name="config-json"></a>4.1 Configure your cluster

In this step you create a YAML configuration file that is customized for your environment. DC/OS uses this configuration file during installation to generate your cluster installation files. In these instructions we assume that you are using ZooKeeper for shared storage.

1.  Customize this `config.yaml` template file for your environment. <!-- do not change bootstrap_url -->
    
        cluster_config:
          ##########################################
          # DO NOT CHANGE the bootstrap_url value, #
          # unless you have moved installer assets.#
          ##########################################
          bootstrap_url: file:///opt/dcos_install_tmp
          cluster_name: <cluster-name>
          exhibitor_storage_backend: zookeeper
          exhibitor_zk_hosts: <host1>:2181,<host2>:2181,<host3>:2181
          exhibitor_zk_path: /dcos
          master_discovery: static 
          ###########################################
          # Master nodes must be listed in both the #  
          # master_list andtarget_hosts parameters. #
          ###########################################
          master_list:
          - <private-master-ip-1>
          - <private-master-ip-2>
          - <private-master-ip-3>
          resolvers:
          - 8.8.8.8 
          - 8.8.4.4
        
        ssh_config:
          log_directory: /genconf/logs          
          ssh_port: 22
          ssh_user: <username>
          ###########################################################
          # Specify your agent AND master nodes in the target_hosts #
          # parameter. Master nodes must be listed in both the      #
          # master_list and target_hosts parameters.                #
          ###########################################################
          target_hosts:
          - <target-host-privateIP-1>
          - <target-host-privateIP-2>
          - <target-host-privateIP-3>
          - <target-host-privateIP-4>
          - <target-host-privateIP-5>
        
    
    Specify these configuration parameters. <!-- log_directory: /genconf/logs, process_timeout: 120, ssh_key_path: /genconf/ssh-key -->
    
    **bootstrap_url**
    
    :   This parameter specifies the URI path for the DC/OS installer to store the customized DC/OS build files. Use the default value of `bootstrap_url: file:///opt/dcos_install_tmp`, unless you have moved the installer assets from their default location.
    
    **cluster_name**
    :   Specify the name of your cluster.
    
    **exhibitor_storage_backend**
    :   This parameter specifies the type of storage backend for Exhibitor. By default this is set to `zookeeper` in the `config.yaml` template file. During DC/OS installation, a storage system is required for configuring and orchestrating ZooKeeper with Exhibitor on the master nodes. Exhibitor automatically configures your ZooKeeper installation on the master nodes during your DC/OS installation.
    
    **exhibitor_zk_hosts**
    :   Specify a comma-separated list of one or more ZooKeeper node IP addresses to use for configuring the internal Exhibitor instances. Exhibitor uses this ZooKeeper cluster to orchestrate it's configuration.
    
    **master_discovery**
    :   This parameter specifies the Mesos master discovery method. By default this is set to `static` in the `config.yaml` template file. The `static` method uses the Mesos agents to discover the masters by giving each agent a static list of master IPs. The masters must not change IP addresses, and if a master is replaced, the new master must take the old master's IP address
    
    **master_list**
    
    :   Specify a list of your static master IP addresses as a YAML nested series (`-`).
        
        **Important:** Master nodes must be listed in both the `master_list` and `target_hosts` parameters.
    
    **resolvers**
    
    :   Specify a JSON-formatted list of DNS servers for your DC/OS host nodes. You must include the escape characters (``) as shown in the template. Set this parameter to the most authoritative nameservers that you have. If you want to resolve internal hostnames, set it to a nameserver that can resolve them.
        
        *Caution:* If you set the `resolvers` parameter incorrectly, you will permanently damage your configuration and have to reinstall DC/OS.
    
    **log_directory**
    
    :   This parameter specifies the path to the installer host logs generated by the SSH processes. By default this is set to `/genconf/logs`. This should not be changed because `/genconf` is local to the container that is running the installer, and is a mounted volume.
    
    **ssh_port**
    :   This parameter specifies the port to SSH to, for example `22`.
    
    **ssh_user**
    :   This parameter specifies the SSH username, for example `centos`.
    
    **target_hosts**
    
    :   This parameter specifies a complete list of IPv4 addresses to your master and agent nodes. This must be a YAML-formatted nested series (-).
        
        **Important:** Master nodes must be listed in both the `master_list` and `target_hosts` parameters.
    
    For more configuration examples and all available options, see the [configuration file options][4].

2.  Save as `genconf/config.yaml`.

3.  Move your private SSH key to `genconf/ssh_key`. For more information, see the [ssh_key_path][5] parameter.
    
        cp <path-to-key> genconf/ssh_key && chmod 0600 genconf/ssh_key
        

### <a name="install-bash"></a>4.2 Install DC/OS

In this step you create a custom DC/OS build file on your bootstrap node and then install DC/OS onto your cluster. With this installation method you create a bootstrap server that uses your SSH key and connects to every node to automate the deployment.

**Tip:** If something goes wrong and you want to rerun your setup, use these cluster [cleanup instructions][6].

**Prerequisites**

*   A `genconf/config.yaml` file that is optimized for automatic distribution of DC/OS across your nodes with SSH.
*   A `genconf/ip-detect` script.

<!-- Early access URL: https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/EarlyAccess/dcos_generate_config.sh -->

<!-- Stable URL: https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/dcos_generate_config.sh -->

To install DC/OS:

1.  Download and save the DC/OS setup file, `dcos_generate_config.sh`, to the home directory on your bootstrap node. This file is used to create your customized DC/OS build file.
    
    **Important:** Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.io> to obtain the DC/OS setup file.

2.  From your root directory on the bootstrap node, run the DC/OS installer shell script on your bootstrap node to generate a customized DC/OS build. The setup script extracts a Docker container that uses the generic DC/OS install files to create customized DC/OS build files for your cluster. The build files are output to `./genconf/serve/`.
    
        sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --genconf
        
    
    At this point your directory structure should resemble:
    
        ├── dcos-genconf.c9722490f11019b692-cb6b6ea66f696912b0.tar
        ├── dcos_generate_config.sh
        ├── genconf
        │   ├── config.yaml
        │   ├── ip-detect
        │   ├── ssh_key
        

3.  Run this command on your DC/OS setup file to fix a known issue. This command inserts an argument into the `docker run` command for the container which sets an environment variable for `$TERM`.
    
        sed -i.bak "s/docker run -i/docker run -i -e "TERM=linux"/g" dcos_generate_config.sh
        

4.  Run a preflight script to validate that your cluster is installable.
    
        sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --preflight 
        
    
    Here is an example of the output.
    
        Running mesosphere/dcos-genconf docker BUILD_DIR set to /home/someuser/genconf 
        ... 
        Running preflight checks
        
    
    **Tip:** For a detailed view, you can add log level debug (`-v`) to your command. For example `sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --preflight -v`.

5.  Install DC/OS on your cluster.
    
        sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --deploy
        
    
    Here is an example of the output.
    
        Running mesosphere/dcos-genconf docker with BUILD_DIR set to /home/someuser/genconf
        ...
        Starting DC/OS install process
        Running preflight checks
        Creating directories under /etc/mesosphere
        Creating role file for master
        Configuring DC/OS
        Setting and starting DC/OS
        
        Cleaning up temp directory /opt/dcos_install_tmp
        

6.  Run the DC/OS diagnostic script to verify that services are up and running.
    
        sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh --postflight
        

7.  Monitor Exhibitor and wait for your masters to converge at `http://<public-master-ip>:8181/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html`.
    
    **Tip:** This process can take about 10 minutes. During this time you will see the Master nodes become visible on the Exhibitor consoles and come online, eventually showing a green light.

    When the status icons are green, you can access the DC/OS web interface.

8.  Launch the DC/OS web interface at: `http://<public-master-ip>/`:

### <a name="config-json"></a>4.1 Configure your cluster

In this step you create a YAML configuration file that is customized for your environment. DC/OS uses this configuration file during installation to generate your cluster installation files. In these instructions we assume that you are using ZooKeeper for shared storage.

1.  Customize this `config.yaml` template file for your environment. <!-- bootstrap_url is changeable -->
    
        cluster_config:
          bootstrap_url: http://<bootstrap_ip>:<your_port>       
          cluster_name: '<cluster-name>'
          exhibitor_storage_backend: zookeeper
          exhibitor_zk_hosts: <host1>:2181
          exhibitor_zk_path: /dcos
          master_discovery: static 
          master_list:
          - <private-master-ip-1>
          - <private-master-ip-2>
          - <private-master-ip-3>
          resolvers:
          - <dns-resolver-1>
          - <dns-resolver-2>
        
    
    Specify these configuration parameters. <!-- log_directory: /genconf/logs, process_timeout: 120, ssh_key_path: /genconf/ssh-key -->
    
    **cluster_name**
    :   Specify the name of your cluster.
    
    **bootstrap_url**
    
    :   This parameter specifies the URI path for the DC/OS installer to store the customized DC/OS build files, which can be local (`bootstrap_url:file:///opt/dcos_install_tmp`) or hosted (`http://<your-web-server>`). By default this is set to `file:///opt/dcos_install_tmp` in the `config.yaml` template file, which is the location where the DC/OS installer puts your install tarball.
        
        **Tip:** This parameter is for advanced users. The default value should work for most installations.
    
    **exhibitor_storage_backend**
    :   This parameter specifies the type of storage backend for Exhibitor. By default this is set to `zookeeper` in the `config.yaml` template file. During DC/OS installation, a storage system is required for configuring and orchestrating Zookeeper with Exhibitor on the master nodes. Exhibitor automatically configures your Zookeeper installation on the master nodes during your DC/OS installation.
    
    **exhibitor_zk_hosts**
    :   Specify a comma-separated list of one or more Zookeeper node IP addresses to use for configuring the internal Exhibitor instances. Exhibitor uses this Zookeeper cluster to orchestrate it's configuration.

Set this parameter to the most authoritative nameservers that you have. If you want to resolve internal hostnames, set it to a nameserver that can resolve them.
        
        *Caution:* If you set the `resolvers` parameter incorrectly, you will permanently damage your configuration and have to reinstall DC/OS.
    
    For more configuration examples and all available options, see the [configuration file options][4].

2.  Save as `genconf/config.yaml`.

## <a name="install-bash"></a>4.2 Install DC/OS

In this step you create a custom DC/OS build file on your bootstrap node and then install DC/OS onto your cluster. With this method you package the DC/OS distribution yourself and connect to every server manually and run the commands.

**Tip:** If something goes wrong and you want to rerun your setup, use these cluster [cleanup instructions][5].

**Prerequisites**

*   A `genconf/config.yaml` file that is optimized for manual distribution of DC/OS across your nodes.
*   A `genconf/ip-detect` script. 
*   The Docker NGINX image must be on your bootstrap node. You can use this command to install the NGINX container:
    
         docker pull nginx
        
    
    For more information, see <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/" target="_blank">DockerHub NGINX</a> documentation.

<!-- Early access URL: https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/EarlyAccess/dcos_generate_config.sh -->

<!-- Stable URL: https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/dcos_generate_config.sh --> To install DC/OS:

1.  Download and save the DC/OS setup file, `dcos_generate_config.sh`, to the root directory on your bootstrap node. This file is used to create your customized DC/OS build file.
    
    **Important:** Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.io> to obtain the DC/OS setup file.
    
    At this point your directory structure should resemble:
    
        ├── dcos-genconf.c9722490f11019b692-cb6b6ea66f696912b0.tar
        ├── dcos_generate_config.sh
        ├── genconf
        │   ├── config.yaml
        │   ├── ip-detect
        

2.  Run this command on your DC/OS setup file to fix a known issue. This command inserts an argument into the `docker run` command for the container which sets an environment variable for `$TERM`.
    
        sed -i.bak "s/docker run -i/docker run -i -e "TERM=linux"/g" dcos_generate_config.sh
        

3.  From your root directory, run the DC/OS installer shell script on your bootstrapping master nodes to generate a customized DC/OS build. The setup script extracts a Docker container that uses the generic DC/OS install files to create customized DC/OS build files for your cluster. The build files are output to `./genconf/serve/`.
    
            sudo bash dcos_generate_config.sh
        
    
    **Tip:** For the install script to work, you must have created `genconf/config.yaml` and `genconf/ip-detect`.

4.  From your root directory, run this command to host the DC/OS install package through an NGINX Docker container. For `<your-port>`, specify the port value that is used in the `bootstrap_url`.
    
        docker run -d -p <your-port>:80 -v $PWD/genconf/serve:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro nginx
        

5.  Run these commands on each of your master nodes in succession to install DC/OS using your custom build file.
    
    **Tip:** Although there is no actual harm to your cluster, DC/OS may issue error messages until all of your master nodes are configured.
    
    1.  SSH to your master node:
        
            ssh <master-ip>
            
    
    2.  Make a new directory and navigate to it:
        
            mkdir /tmp/dcos && cd /tmp/dcos
            
    
    3.  Download the DC/OS installer from the NGINX Docker container, where `<bootstrap-ip>` and `<your_port>` are specified in `bootstrap_url`:
        
            curl -O http://<bootstrap-ip>:<your_port>/dcos_install.sh
            
    
    4.  Run this command to install DC/OS on your master nodes:
        
            sudo bash dcos_install.sh master
            

6.  Run these commands on each of your agent nodes to install DC/OS using your custom build file.
    
    1.  SSH to your node:
        
            ssh <agent-ip>
            
    
    2.  Make a new directory and navigate to it:
        
            mkdir /tmp/dcos && cd /tmp/dcos
            
    
    3.  Download the DC/OS installer from the NGINX Docker container, where `<bootstrap-ip>` and `<your_port>` are specified in `bootstrap_url`:
        
            curl http://<bootstrap-ip>:<your_port>/dcos_install.sh
            
    
    4.  Run this command to install DC/OS on your agent node:
        
            sudo bash dcos_install.sh slave
            

7.  Monitor Exhibitor and wait for your masters to converge at `http://<public-master-ip>:8181/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html`.
    
    **Tip:** This process can take about 10 minutes. During this time you will see the Master nodes become visible on the Exhibitor consoles and come online, eventually showing a green light.
