      Users with the <code>dcos:superuser</code> permission have full access rights across the DC/OS cluster. Members of the <code>superusers</code> group automatically inherit the <code>dcos:superuser</code> permission. During installation, the initial user account is added to the <code>superusers</code> group. At least one user must have the <code>dcos:superuser</code> permission at any given time. <b>Tip:</b> We recommend adding users to the <code>superusers</code> group rather than assigning them the <code>superuser</code> permission. This will make it easier for you to keep track of the users with this permission.
