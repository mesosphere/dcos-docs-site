This DC/OS 101 tutorial will guide you through the steps necessary to get started using DC/OS.

The tutorial is designed to provide users and applications developers an overview of the basic pieces of DC/OS. We will discuss basic recipes for developing and orchestrating applications for a distributed landscape. To provide hands-on experience, we will develop and deploy multiple applications (including stateful, dockerized, and non-dockerized) on an actual cluster during each step of the tutorial. To provide even more rationale and background information the tutorial also includes optional deep dives into relevant topics.
