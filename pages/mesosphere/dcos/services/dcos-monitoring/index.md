The DC/OS Monitoring service makes it easy to monitor DC/OS components and your services on the DC/OS cluster. It can be configured to automatically load Grafana dashboard and alert configurations from Git repositories. It also ships with a set of default Grafana dashboards for monitoring DC/OS itself. The service can be configured to automatically load Alertmanager configuration from a Git repository.
