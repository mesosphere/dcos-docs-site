This page describes how to download and install the {{ model.techName }} service.
By default, Prometheus and Grafana are run with the default configuration options.
Alertmanager is off by default and must be configured to be turned on.

# Prerequisites

- DC/OS 1.12 or later.
- [DC/OS CLI](/latest/cli/install/) is installed.
- You are logged in as a superuser.

# Install {{ model.techName }} service

## Download the package

The {{ model.techName }} package is installable via the [catalog](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.13/gui/catalog/).

## Install the service

Use the following command to install the service.

```bash
dcos package install {{ model.packageName }} --package-version=<VERSION>
```

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>The command `dcos package install` will install the {{ model.techName }} service as well as the package CLI.</p>

## {{ model.techName }} CLI

You can install the {{ model.techName }} CLI with the following command.

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>If you install {{ model.techName }} via the DC/OS GUI, you must install the {{ model.techName }} CLI as a separate step from the DC/OS CLI.<p>

```bash
dcos package install {{ model.packageName }} --cli
```

Configure the {{ model.techName }} CLI with the package name.

```bash
dcos config set monitoring.service_name {{ model.packageName }}
```

## Verify service deployment

After installing the package CLI, you can monitor the deployment of your service by executing the following command:

```bash
dcos monitoring plan show deploy
```

You can also go to the **Services > Deployments** tab of the DC/OS GUI to monitor the deployment.

# Access Grafana dashboards

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>It is recommended to access Grafana via <a href="https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/edge-lb/1.3/">Edge-LB</a>. If you access Grafana via AdminRouter then it can limit the capabilities of Grafana. For example, some graphs will not work under load.</p>

Assuming the service name is `{{ model.serviceName }}` (default), you should be able to access the Grafana dashboards using the following URL:

```bash
https://<CLUSTER_URL>/service/{{ model.serviceName }}/grafana/
```
