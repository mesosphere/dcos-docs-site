Elasticsearch is a distributed, multitenant-capable, full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch clusters are highly available, fault tolerant, and durable. Multiple Elasticsearch clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Elasticsearch as a managed service to your organization with or without the commercial X-Pack capabilities.
