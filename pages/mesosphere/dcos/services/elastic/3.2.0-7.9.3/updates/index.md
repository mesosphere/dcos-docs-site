When you update from an earlier version of {{ model.techName }}, your service will automatically be upgraded first to any intervening versions, and then to the latest version. See [Viewing available versions](/mesosphere/dcos/services/elastic/3.2.0-7.9.3/updates/#viewing-available-versions) to see which versions of {{ model.techName }} are currently supported.
