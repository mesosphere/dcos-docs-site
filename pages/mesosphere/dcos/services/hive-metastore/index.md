DC/OS Hive Metastore is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Hive Metastore on Mesosphere DC/OS, eliminating nearly all of the complexity traditionally associated with managing a Metastore cluster. Hive Metastore is a metadata store for all Hive object definitions such as databases, tables, and functions. The Metastore can persist these definitions to a relational database (RDBMS) and can be configured to embed the Apache Derby RDBMS or connect to an external RDBMS (such as MySQL). The Metastore can be configured to be highly available, fault tolerant, and durable.
