## dcos storage profile deactivate

Deactivate an active volume profile.

### Synopsis

Required arguments:

    <name>     The name of the volume profile.

Volume profiles cannot be changed once they have been created (i.e., they are
immutable) and they also cannot be removed. Instead of removing volume
profiles, you can deactivate a volume profile. No new volumes can be created
with a volume profile that has been deactivated.

You can reactivate a deactivated profile using the `reactivate` command.

```bash
dcos storage profile deactivate --name <name> [flags]
```

### Examples

1. Create a volume profile then deactivate it and try to create a volume of that profile:

```bash
# Create the 'safe' profile.
cat <<EOF | dcos storage profile create
{
    "name": "safe",
    "description": "Volumes backed by RAID-1 devices.",
    "spec": {
        "provider-selector": {
            "plugin": "lvm",
            "matches": {
                "labels": {"raid": "1"}
            }
        },
        "mount": {}
    }
}
EOF
```
```bash
# Create a volume from volume profile 'safe'.
dcos storage volume create --name my-volume-1 --capacity 10G --profile safe

# Deactivate the 'safe' volume profile.
dcos storage profile deactivate --name safe

# Try and create a new volume from volume profile 'safe'.
dcos storage volume create --name my-volume-2 --capacity 10G --profile safe
```
```
Error: Profile is not active.
```
