## Package Versioning Scheme

- {{ model.techName }}: 0.4.2-3.6.10
- DC/OS: 1.10 and 1.11

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of [{{ model.techName }}](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb). For example, `0.4.2-3.6.10` indicates version `0.4.2` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.6.10` of [{{ model.techName }}](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb).

## Version Policy

The DC/OS {{ model.techName }} Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of [{{ model.techName }}](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb). We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from [{{ model.techName }}](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb) for new releases.

The use of other [{{ model.techName }}](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb) versions is unsupported and will likely cause issues.
