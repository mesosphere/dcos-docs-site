# Configuration Best Practices for Production

- Increase the number of TCP socket ports available. This is particularly important if the flow will be setting up and tearing down a large number of sockets in a short time.

```shell
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="10000 65000"
```

- Tell Linux you never want DC/OS {{model.techName }} to swap. Swapping is fantastic for some applications. It is not good for something like DC/OS {{model.techName }} that always wants to be running.

To set swapping off you can edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to add the following line

```shell
vm.swappiness = 0
```

For the partitions handling the various DC/OS {{model.techName }} repos turn off things like `atime`. Doing so can cause a surprising bump in throughput. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and for the partition(s) of interest add the `noatime` option.

## Hardware Sizing Recommendations

The following image shows the recommended hardware for a DC/OS {{model.techName }} production installation:

## Disk Recommendations

DC/OS {{model.techName }} performs best when using disks with fast read and write patterns.

We recommend the following:

- Always prefer locally-attached storage. Remote storage adds points of failure, add latency/overhead to block requests and are more complicated to troubleshoot.  
- For better performance, use solid-state disks vs. spinning disks, or allocate more memory to cache more data, reducing the use of disks.
