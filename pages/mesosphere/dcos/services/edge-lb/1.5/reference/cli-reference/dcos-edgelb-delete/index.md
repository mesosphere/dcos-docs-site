## Permissions
To delete an existing pool and uninstall the deployed load balancers, the Edge-LB service account or user account must have the following permission for a specified pool:

```

## Examples
To delete the Edge-LB pool named `pubs-multi-lb`, you would run the following command:

dcos edgelb delete pubs-multi-lb
```

If the pool name you specified is currently deployed, the command returns information similar to the following:

```bash
Successfully deleted pubs-delete-lb. Check the DC/OS web UI for pool uninstall status.
```

```
