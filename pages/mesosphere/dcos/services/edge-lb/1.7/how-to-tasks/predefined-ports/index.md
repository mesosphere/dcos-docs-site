excerpt: How to expose tasks using a pre-assigned port for Edge-LB load balancing
enterprise: false
---

You can expose tasks for load balancing using a pre-assigned port or by assigning a port dynamically.

# Before you begin
You must have:
* Edge-LB installed as described in the Edge-LB [installation instructions](/mesosphere/dcos/services/edge-lb/1.7/getting-started/installing).
* The core DC/OS command-line interface (CLI) installed and configured to communicate with the DC/OS cluster.
* The `edgelb` command-line interface (CLI) installed.
* An active and properly-configured DC/OS Enterprise cluster, with at least one DC/OS **private agent** node to run the load-balanced service and at least one DC/OS **public agent** node for exposing the load-balanced service.

# Exposing a task without pre-assigned ports
This feature allows you to expose task without a pre-assigned port.

Prior versions of Edge-LB only exposed tasks that had a port assigned by the Apache&reg; Mesos&reg; framework. Although most Mesos tasks are assigned a port for execution, the port assignment is not always required. For load balancing, however, a port assignment is required. To satisfy this requirement when you are using Edge-LB, you can manually specify a port in the pool configuration file to expose the task if no port has been previously assigned for that task.
