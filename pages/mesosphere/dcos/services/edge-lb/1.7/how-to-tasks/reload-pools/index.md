This section describes the common reload and relaunch scenarios for Edge-LB pools and how to restore load balancing for a service after a pod failure.

# Before you begin
Before you create Edge-LB pools and pool configuration files, you should have DC/OS&trade; Enterprise cluster nodes installed and ready to use, and have previously downloaded and installed the latest Edge-LB packages.

You must have:
* Edge-LB installed as described in the Edge-LB [installation instructions](/mesosphere/dcos/services/edge-lb/1.7/getting-started/installing).
* The core DC/OS command-line interface (CLI) installed and configured to communicate with the DC/OS cluster.
* The `edgelb` command-line interface (CLI) installed.
* An active and properly-configured DC/OS Enterprise cluster, with at least one DC/OS **private agent** node to run the load-balanced service and at least one DC/OS **public agent** node for exposing the load-balanced service.

For information about installing Edge-LB packages, see the [installation](/mesosphere/dcos/services/edge-lb/1.7/getting-started/installing/) instructions.

# Normal reload scenario
A change to a service (such as scaling up) that is load balanced by a pool, automatically triggers a reload of the pool configuration file, and restarts the load balancer instances for that service.

During this type of normal reload scenario, you can expect the following behavior:
* No traffic is dropped unless the service instance that was serving the request was killed.

* The load balancer will keep any existing long-running connections intact.

* All the new connections will be proxied using the new reloaded configuration.

This type of reload occurs at most once every 3 seconds. Normal reload operations play a key role in enabling zero-downtime deployment strategies like the one described in the [Blue/Green service deployment](/mesosphere/dcos/services/edge-lb/1.7/tutorials/blue-green-deploy) tutorial.

# Load balancer relaunch scenario
A change to the load balancer pool (such as adding a secret) triggers a relaunch of all load balancers in the pool.

During this type of load balancer relaunch scenario, you can expect the following behavior:
* Traffic currently flowing through the given load balancer is dropped when it is stopped. To minimize the impact of stopping and restarting a load balancer instance, you should run more than one load balancer instance within the pool.

* Only one load balancer is stopped in the pool during the update at a time.

* The load balancer will be relaunched on the same node (unless the node itself has failed).
<!--
<p class="message--warning"><strong> WARNING: </strong>The number of instances of load balancers cannot be scaled down. This limitation will be addressed in a future Edge-LB release.</p> -->

# Replacing a failed pod
By default, Edge-LB load balancer instances are tied to a given node. If the node goes down, Edge-LB does not automatically relocate the pod containing the Edge-LB load balancer instance to a new node. You must issue a `pod replace` command to the pool scheduler to tell it to start the load balancer instance on a new node. If a machine hosting a pod is permanently lost, manual intervention is required to discard the missing pod and start it on a new node.

You can perform the necessary steps using the `edgelb-pool` command-line interface subcommand. The `edgelb-pool` command-line interface is distinct from the `edgelb` subcommand that is installed with the Edge-LB package. You must install the `edgelb-pool` command-line interface separately if you have not previously installed this package.

1. Install the `edgelb-pool` CLI subcommand:

    ```bash
    dcos package install edgelb-pool --cli --yes
    ```

2. Get the name of the pool that owns the pod you need to relocate:

    ```bash
    dcos edgelb list
    ```

    This command lists all of the Edge-LB pool configurations you have deployed. The pool that has a missing pod in this list identifies the `<pool-name>` you specify in the next step.

3. Get the name of the pod you need to replace (the pod that was running on the removed public agent):

    ```bash
    dcos edgelb-pool --name=/dcos-edgelb/pools/<pool-name> pod list
    ```

    This command returns the pod name you will specify for the `<pod-id>` in the next step.

4. Replace the `<pod-id>` that is no longer running using the `pod replace` command as follow:

    ```bash
    dcos edgelb-pool --name=/dcos-edgelb/pools/<pool-name> pod replace <pod-id>
    ```

    This command destroys the pool server and relaunchs a new Edge-LB pool on the new public agent.
