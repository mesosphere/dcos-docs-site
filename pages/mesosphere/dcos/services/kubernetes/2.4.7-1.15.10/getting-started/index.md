## Learning Objectives

In this guided tutorial, you will learn many of the basics of using Kubernetes on top of DC/OS Enterprise. Specifically, you will be:

 * setting up the DC/OS Enterprise cluster to be able to connect to the Kubernetes command line (`kubectl`)
 * configuring and securing service accounts for MKE and each Kubernetes cluster to be created
 * installing the Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine and CLI to create Kubernetes clusters
 * configuring DC/OS Edge-LB on top of DC/OS Enterprise to connect to multiple Kubernetes clusters' api servers
 * deploying an Nginx deployment on your new cluster
 * viewing the Kubernetes dashboard

<p class="message-important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>This tutorial assumes you have access to a production DC/OS Enterprise cluster.</p>

## First Section: Installing and Using Kubernetes on DC/OS
