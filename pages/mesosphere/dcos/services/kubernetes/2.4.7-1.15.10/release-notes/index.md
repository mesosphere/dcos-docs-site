# Version 2.4.7-1.15.10

## Breaking Changes from 1.x

* DC/OS Kubernetes `2.4.7-1.15.10` requires DC/OS 1.12.
* DC/OS Kubernetes `2.4.7-1.15.10` introduces breaking changes to the way the package works and is deployed.
  Therefore, it is not possible to upgrade an existing installation of DC/OS Kubernetes 1.x to `2.4.7-1.15.10`.
* Before installing `kubernetes-cluster` package `2.4.7-1.15.10`, the `kubernetes` package must be [installed and running](/mesosphere/dcos/services/kubernetes/2.4.7-1.15.10/getting-started/installing-mke/).
* It is no longer possible to install DC/OS Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise without specifying a [service account](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/security/ent/service-auth/) and a service account secret with adequate [permissions](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/security/ent/perms-reference/).
* Package options have been renamed and re-organized.
  * `node_placement` renamed to `private_node_placement`
  * `reserved_resources` renamed to `private_reserved_resources`
  * `control_plane_reserved_resources` contains the combined resources from previous `1.x` options `apiserver`, `controller_manager` and `scheduler` and `2.0.0-1.12.0-beta` options `control_plane_cpus`, `control_plane_mem` and `control_plane_disk` were moved to under this group.

## Improvements

* Kubernetes 1.15.10
* dcos-commons 0.57.3
* Calico 3.10.3
* Update Debian base container images to version stable-20200130-slim.
