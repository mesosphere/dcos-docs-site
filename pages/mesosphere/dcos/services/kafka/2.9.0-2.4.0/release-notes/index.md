## Version 2.9.0-2.4.0

### Updates
- Upgrade the base tech version of Apache Kafka to `2.4.0`. See Kafka's Release Notes for [2.4.0](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.4.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html) for details.
- Updated the SDK to version [0.57.3](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/0.57.3)
  - [#3215](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/pull/3215) is a major bug-fix since `v0.57.0`. Frameworks are recommended to upgrade to `v0.57.3` and issue `pod replace` commands to exisiting deployments to mitigate the risks. Existing procedures for [migrating a existing service to the quotated role](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/0.57.0#migrate-an-existing-deployed-service-to-use-quota-support) should be followed.
- Updated the scheduler JRE to `v11`.

### Important Notes
- Apache Kafka 2.4.0 introduces `[KAFKA-7335] - Store clusterId locally to ensure broker joins the right cluster`, which means that a Kafka cluster will store the clusterId locally so that it does not join the wrong Zookeeper cluster accidentally. Therefore, if your Kafka service is connected to default DC/OS Zookeeper, changing the Zookeeper path is not permitted. Please check [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7335) for more information.

## Version 2.8.1-2.3.1

### Updates
- Upgrade the base tech version of Apache Kafka to `2.3.1`. See Kafka's Release Notes for [2.3.1](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.3.1/RELEASE_NOTES.html) for details.

### Improvements
- Improve status check to verify topic successfully created in Zookeeper. In case of failure, the service returns `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` instead of `200 OK`. 

## Version 2.8.0-2.3.0

### Updates
- Updated the SDK to version `0.57.0`. For more information, see release notes for previous SDK releases:
  - [0.57.0](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/0.57.0)
  - [0.56.3](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-commons/releases/tag/0.56.3)

### New Features
- Added new CLI commands ([PR #447](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-kafka-service/pull/447)): 
  - `dcos kafka topic config`
  - `dcos kafka topic delete-config`
  - `dcos kafka acl`
- By upgrading the SDK, Kafka now comes with support for:
  - Quota enforcement
  - Node draining 


<!-- ## Version 2.7.0-2.3.0

### Updates
- Upgrade the base dcos-commons SDK version to `0.56.2`.
- Upgrade the base tech version of Apache Kafka to `2.3.0`. See Kafka's Release Notes for [2.3.0](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.3.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html) for details.
- Option to configure new listener config `max.connections` which limits the number of active connections on each listener.

### New Features
- Added support for DC/OS Storage Service (DSS). See official [DSS docs](https://docs.d2iq.com/mesosphere/dcos/services/storage/1.0.0) for more details.

## Version 2.6.0-2.2.1

### Updates
- Upgrade {{ model.techShortName }} base tech to version `2.2.1`. See [{{ model.techShortName }}'s Release Notes](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.2.1/RELEASE_NOTES.html) for details.
- Upgrade the base dcos-commons SDK version to `0.56.1`.
- Oracle JDK is replaced by OpenJDK 8.

### New Features
- Autosuggestion is available for Service Account and Secrets when launching the service from DC/OS UI
- Support for <a href="/mesosphere/dcos/services/kafka/2.6.0-2.2.1/advanced/#secure-jmx-enterprise">Secure JMX</a>
- Added marathon service scheduler checks
- Service will fetch all required resources over HTTPS

## Version 2.5.0-2.1.0

### Important Notes

* The `inter_broker_protocol_version` now defaults to the newer `2.1` version. This has a few implications, as described below:

    - Kafka 1.1.0 supports `inter_broker_protocol_version`: `1.1` maximum, and by default it is set to `1.0`.
    - Kafka 2.1.0 supports `inter_broker_protocol_version`s up to `2.1`. 
    - If you haven't specified a `inter_broker_protocol_version` in your options file, the new default will be used and changed to `2.1`. This will cause downtime during the upgrade when some Kafka nodes will be on Kafka 1.1.0 using `inter_broker_protocol_version` `1.0` and others will be on Kafka 2.1.0 using protocol `2.1`.

    To avoid any potential downtime, change the protocol version used when upgrading Kafka.

    - Set up CLI to connect to a soak cluster
    - Update your `options_file.json` with the following contents:
        ```
        {
            ...
            "kafka": {
                ...
                "inter_broker_protocol_version": "1.0"
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
        ```

    - And update your service like so:
       ```
       ~$ dcos package install --cli --yes kafka
       ~$ dcos kafka --name=data-services/kafka update start \
           --package-version=2.5.0-2.1.0 \
           --options=options_file.json
       ```
