Welcome to the documentation for version 2.0.1 of the {{ model.techName }} service. 

{{ model.techName }} is the next-generation interface for Project Jupyter, offering the same tools that are familiar to Jupyter Notebook users: terminal, text editor, notebook, file browser, and so forth. Users can work with text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other components in a notebook with tabbed work areas.
