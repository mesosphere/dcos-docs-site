Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Prometheus is designed for reliability, to be the system you go to during an outage to allow you to quickly diagnose problems. It is a monitoring platform that collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints on these targets. Each Prometheus server is standalone, not depending on network storage or other remote services.
