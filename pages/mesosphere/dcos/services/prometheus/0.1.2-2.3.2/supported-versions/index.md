# Supported Versions

## Package Versioning Scheme

- Prometheus: 2.3.2
- AlertManager 0.15.1
- PushGateway 0.5.2
- DC/OS: 1.10+

Packages are versioned with an a.b.c-x.y.z format, where a.b.c is the version of the DC/OS integration and x.y.z indicates the version of Prometheus. For example, 0.1.2-2.3.2 indicates version 0.1.2 of the DC/OS integration and version 2.3.2 of Prometheus.

## Version Policy

The DC/OS Prometheus Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of Prometheus, AlertManager and PushGateway.
