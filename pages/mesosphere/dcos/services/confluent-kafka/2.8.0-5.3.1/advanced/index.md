|----------------------|-------------|
| jmx.enabled | Enables the secure JMX |
| jmx.port | JMX port |
| jmx.rmi_port | JMX RMI port |
| jmx.access_file | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the access file. |
| jmx.password_file | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the password file. |
| jmx.key_store | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the key store. |
| jmx.key_store_password_file | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the key store password file. |
| jmx.add_trust_store | Enables the user provided trust store. |
| jmx.trust_store | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the trust store. |
| jmx.trust_store_password_file | The path to the secret in the Secret Store that has the contents of the trust store password file. |

### Configuring JMX with self-signed certificate

1. Generate a self-signed key store and trust store.

    ```bash
    $ keytool -genkey -alias server-cert -keyalg rsa  -dname "CN=kafka.example.com,O=Example Company,C=US"  -keystore keystore.ks -storetype JKS -storepass changeit -keypass changeit
    ```

    ```bash
    $ keytool -genkey -alias server-cert -keyalg rsa  -dname "CN=kafka.example.com,O=Example Company,C=US"  -keystore truststore.ks -storetype JKS -storepass changeit -keypass changeit
    ```

1. Generate files containing the trust store and key store passwords.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF >> trust_store_pass
    changeit
    EOF
    ```

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF >> key_store_pass
    changeit
    EOF
    ```

1. Create a JMX access file.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF >> access_file
    admin readwrite
    user  readonly
    EOF
    ```

1. Create a JMX password file.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF >> password_file
    admin  adminpassword
    user   userpassword
    EOF
    ```

1. Create necessary secrets in DC/OS for JMX.

    ```bash
    dcos package install dcos-enterprise-cli --yes
    dcos security secrets create -f keystore.ks kafka/keystore
    dcos security secrets create -f key_store_pass kafka/keystorepass
    dcos security secrets create -f truststore.ks kafka/truststore
    dcos security secrets create -f trust_store_pass kafka/truststorepass
    dcos security secrets create -f password_file kafka/passwordfile
    dcos security secrets create -f access_file kafka/access
    ```

1. Create a custom service configuration `options.json` with JMX enabled.

    ```json
    {
      "service": {
        "jmx": {
          "enabled": true,
          "port": 31299,
          "rmi_port": 31298,
          "access_file": "kafka/access",
          "password_file": "kafka/passwordfile",
          "key_store": "kafka/keystore",
          "key_store_password_file": "kafka/keystorepass",
          "add_trust_store": true,
          "trust_store": "kafka/truststore",
          "trust_store_password_file": "kafka/truststorepass"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Install {{ model.techName }} with the options file you created.

    ```bash
    dcos package install {{ model.packageName }} --options="options.json"
    ```

## Service Health Check

DC/OS {{ model.techName }} supports service oriented health checks allowing you to monitor your service health in details.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| health_check.enabled | Enables the health checks |
| health_check.method | "PORT" or "FUNCTIONAL" |
| health_check.interval | The period in seconds to wait after the last health check has completed to start the next check. |
| health_check.delay | An amount of time in seconds to wait before starting the health check attempts. |
| health_check.timeout | An amount of time in seconds to wait for a health check to succeed. |
| health_check.grace-period | An amount of time in seconds after the task is launched during which health check failures are ignored. Once a health check succeeds for the first time, the grace period does not apply anymore. Note that it includes delay seconds, i.e., setting grace_period seconds < delay seconds has no effect. |
| health_check.max-consecutive-failures | It is the maximum consecutive number of failures after which task will be killed. |
| health_check.health-check-topic-prefix | Prefix for the health check topic name. Used when "FUNCTIONAL" health check method is selected. |
| service.security.kerberos.health_check_primary | The [Kerberos](/mesosphere/dcos/services/confluent-kafka/latest/security/#authentication) primary used by Kafka health check if enabled. |

### Health Check Methods

#### Port Check

This method will check if the broker port is open. Only the broker on which the health check is running will be checked as each broker will have its own health check.

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "confluent-kafka",
    "health_check": {
      "enabled": true,
      "method": "PORT",
    }
  }
}
```

####  Functional Check

This method checks if the broker can send and receive messages from a client. Only the broker on which the health check is running will be checked, as each broker will have its own health check.
The health check produces a random message to a user configurable topic and then tries to consume the last produced message.
When [Kerberos](/mesosphere/dcos/services/confluent-kafka/latest/security/#authentication) and/or [Transport Encryption](mesosphere/dcos/services/kafka/latest/security/#transport-encryption) is enabled, the health check produces only a single random message to a topic and will attempt to consume that same first message of the topic at each health-check interval.

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "confluent-kafka",
    "health_check": {
      "enabled": true,
      "method": "FUNCTIONAL",
      "health-check-topic-prefix": "MyHealthCheckTopic"
    }
  }
}
```
