## Authentication

You can opt out of the provided authentication by disabling it for your cluster. To disable authentication, add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) file during installation (this requires using the [installation](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/installing/production/deploying-dcos/installation/) method):

```yaml
oauth_enabled: 'false'
```

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you have already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in place, you can go through an upgrade with the same <a href="/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/"> configuration parameter</a> set.</p>



## Telemetry

- Add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) file during installation (this requires using the [installation][1] method):

    ```yaml

    ```



<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you have already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in place, you can go through an upgrade with the same <a href="/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/"> configuration parameter</a> set.</p>
