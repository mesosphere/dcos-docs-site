Mesosphere&reg; DC/OS&trade; is a distributed operating system based on the Apache&reg; Mesos&reg; distributed systems kernel. It lets you manage multiple machines as if they were a single computer. DC/OS automates resource management, schedules process placement, facilitates inter-process communication, and simplifies the installation and management of distributed services. Its included web interface and available command-line interface (CLI) facilitate remote management and monitoring of the cluster and its services.
