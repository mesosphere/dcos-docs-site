Mesosphere&reg; DC/OS&reg; applications lose their state when they terminate and are relaunched. In some contexts, for instance, if your application uses MySQL&reg;, or if you are using a stateful service like Kafka&reg; or Cassandra&reg;, you'll want your application to preserve its state. This section will show you how to create stateful applications to preserve your application in case of termination and relaunch.
