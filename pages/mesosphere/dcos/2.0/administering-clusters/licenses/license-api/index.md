# Routes

Access to the License API is proxied through the Admin Router on each master node using the following route:

```bash
/licensing/v1
```

To determine the URL of your cluster, see [Cluster Access](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/api/access/).

# Format

The License API request and response bodies are formatted in JSON.

Requests must include the accept header:

```bash
Accept: application/json
```

Responses include the content type header:

```bash
Content-Type: application/json
```

or

```bash
Content-Type: application/x-tar
```

# Authentication

All License API routes require authentication to use.

To authenticate API requests, see [Obtaining an authentication token](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/security/ent/iam-api/#obtaining-an-authentication-token) and [Passing an authentication token](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/security/ent/iam-api/#passing-an-authentication-token).

The License API also requires authorization via the following permissions:

| Resource ID | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| `dcos:adminrouter:licensing` | `full` |

All routes can also be reached by users with the `dcos:superuser` permission.

To assign permissions to your account, see the [permissions reference](/mesosphere/dcos/2.0/security/ent/perms-reference/).
