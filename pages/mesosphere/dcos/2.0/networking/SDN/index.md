Mesosphere&reg; DC/OS&trade; allows UCR and Docker containers to be launched on a wide variety of Software Defined Networks (SDNs). It supports [Container Networking Interface (CNI&reg;)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) standard for UCR and the [Container Network Model (CNM)](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design.md) standard for Docker&reg;.

DC/OS comes with its own native virtual networking solution, called DC/OS Overlay, which supports both the CNI and CNM standards.

## IPv6 support for Docker Containers
Since DC/OS 1.11, DC/OS overlay has built in support for creating IPv6 networks for Docker containers.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>IPv6 support is currently available only for Docker containers and not for UCR containers.</p>
