Each DC/OS Enterprise cluster has a DC/OS certificate authority (CA). By default the DC/OS CA uses a globally unique root CA certificate generated during the installation of DC/OS. This CA certificate is used to sign certificates for the components of DC/OS such as Admin Router. Instead of using the default root CA certificate, you can configure DC/OS Enterprise to use a specific CA certificate, either a root CA certificate or an intermediate signing certificate. (See examples [below](#example-use-cases))

Using a custom CA certificate for your DC/OS Enterprise cluster provides several benefits over using the default CA certificate:

- Ensures that all X.509 certificates used within the DC/OS cluster, for both signing and encrypting, derive from your organization's X.509 certification hierarchy.
- Controls security properties of the key pair, such as type and strength, used for signing DC/OS component certificates.
- Ensures that all DC/OS components, including Admin Router, present browser-trusted certificates.
- Allows replacement of expiring or compromised certificates without reinstalling the cluster.

# Custom CA certificate support
- Only RSA and Elliptic Curve (EC) certificates are supported.
- DC/OS Enterprise 1.9 and earlier do **not** support custom signing certificates.
- DC/OS Enterprise 2.1.1, 2.1.0, 2.0.0–2.0.6, and all versions of DC/OS 1 do **not** support modification (addition, removal, or replacement) of signing certificates in an existing cluster.
- If Calico is enabled in DC/OS Enterprise 2.1 and later, modifying a CA certificate will restart Docker on agent nodes, stopping any workloads running on the agent.

# Glossary 
- **Signing certificate:** A CA certificate that will be used to issue certificates for DC/OS components such as Admin Router. The custom signing certificate is either an intermediate signing certificate (issued by another CA) or a root CA certificate (self-signed by the custom CA). Provide the signing certificate in PEM format (starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`).

- **Signing key:** The signing key associated with the signing certificate. Provide the signing key in unencrypted PKCS8 format (starting with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`).

- **Signing certificate chain:** The complete CA certification chain required for end-entity certificate verification. It must include the certificates of all parent CAs of the signing certificate up to and including the root CA certificate. If the signing certificate is a root certificate, the chain must be empty. Provide the certificates in PEM format (starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`).

- **Installation directory:** The directory on the bootstrap node where the DC/OS installer resides. It is denoted by `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR` in this document.

- **DC/OS configuration file:** The file which contains the DC/OS configuration parameters. The DC/OS configuration file is typically called `config.yaml` and must be present in the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/` directory on the bootstrap node during the installation.


# Adding or replacing a custom CA certificate

## Signing CA files

Prepare files containing the signing certificate, the signing key, and, if required, the signing certificate chain.

A simple way to generate the CA is to use the OpenSSL command line. First create a configuration file:
```bash
cat > openssl-ca.cnf <<EOF
HOME                = .
RANDFILE            = \$ENV::HOME/.rnd

[ ca ]
default_ca          = CA_default

[ CA_default ]
default_md          = sha256

[ req ]
distinguished_name  = ca_distinguished_name
x509_extensions     = ca_extensions
string_mask         = utf8only
prompt              = no

# Set for your organization
[ ca_distinguished_name ]
countryName         = US
stateOrProvinceName = Nebraska
localityName        = Lincoln
organizationName    = Example
commonName          = DC/OS CA

[ ca_extensions ]
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always, issuer
basicConstraints       = critical, CA:true
keyUsage               = keyCertSign, cRLSign
EOF
```
then run the command:
```bash
openssl req -config openssl-ca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout dcos-ca.key -x509 -days 1850 -out dcos-ca.crt
```

You should review the security requirements for your organization to determine a suitable way to create or obtain CA certificates.

On the bootstrap node copy the files to the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/` directory.

For security reasons, the installer will not copy the signing key file from the bootstrap node to the master nodes.
Manually distribute the signing key to every DC/OS master node **before starting the installation**.
If you copy the signing key file over the network onto the master nodes, the network channel must be adequately protected.

On each master node create the directory `/var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/CA/private/` owned by the `root` user and with permission mode 0700. Copy the signing key file to `/var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/CA/private/custom_ca.key`. Ensure that the signing key file is owned by the `root` user and is only accessible to the owner (permission mode 0600).

## DC/OS Configuration

Add the paths for the signing CA files to the DC/OS configuration file.
The paths must be relative to `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR` and hence will always start with `genconf/`.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>If Calico is enabled then changing these configuration values for an existing cluster will restart Docker on agent nodes. This will terminate running workloads.</p>

### ca\_certificate\_path
Path (relative to the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR`) to a file containing the signing certificate. For example: `genconf/dcos-ca.crt`. It can be either a self-signed root certificate or an intermediate certificate signed by another certificate authority.

The DC/OS CA will use this certificate for signing end-entity certificates. The subject of this certificate will be the issuer for certificates signed by the DC/OS CA. If not provided the DC/OS cluster generates a unique root certificate during the initial bootstrap phase and uses that as the signing certificate.

### ca\_certificate\_key\_path
Path (relative to the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR`) to a file containing the signing key. For example: `genconf/dcos-ca.key`.

This is highly sensitive data. The configuration processor accesses this file only for configuration validation, and does not copy the data.

This path is required if `ca_certificate_path` is specified.

### ca\_certificate\_chain\_path
Path (relative to the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR`) to a file containing the complete CA certification chain required for end-entity certificate verification. For example: `genconf/dcos-ca-chain.pem`.

If `ca_certificate_path` points to a self-signed root certificate then omit this parameter.

Otherwise `ca_certificate_chain_path` points to a file containing the complete chain of certificates up to a self-signed root certificate, but excluding the signing certificate contained in `ca_certificate_path`. The order is significant: the first certificate must verify the signing certificate in `ca_certificate_path` and each subsequent certificate must verify the preceding certificate.

## Install or patch DC/OS

Proceed with the installation or patch upgrade by running the appropriate `dcos_generate_config.ee.sh` command as described in the [documentation of the Advanced Installer](/mesosphere/dcos/2.2/installing/production). Note that the current working directory when executing `dcos_generate_config.ee.sh` must be the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR` directory.

## Verify installation
To verify that the DC/OS Enterprise cluster was installed with the custom signing certificate, use your browser to access the DC/OS web UI and inspect the certificate and check that the CA has the expected DN.

Alternatively, you can follow these steps:

Select a master node to test:
```bash
MASTER=172.28.128.21
```

You will need the CA certificate. If necessary, retrieve it from the master node using:
```bash
curl -k -v https://${MASTER}/ca/dcos-ca.crt -o dcos-ca.crt
```

Retrieve the certificate chain from the web UI and verify it with the CA certificate:
```bash
openssl s_client -verify_ip ${MASTER} -CAfile dcos-ca.crt -connect ${MASTER}:443 | grep -e "s:" -e "i:" -e "return code:"
```

The output should look like the following:

```
depth=1 C = US, ST = Nebraska, L = Lincoln, O = Example, CN = DC/OS CA
verify return:1
depth=0 C = US, ST = CA, L = San Francisco, O = "Mesosphere, Inc.", CN = AdminRouter on 172.28.128.21
verify return:1
 0 s:C = US, ST = CA, L = San Francisco, O = "Mesosphere, Inc.", CN = AdminRouter on 172.28.128.21
   i:C = US, ST = Nebraska, L = Lincoln, O = Example, CN = DC/OS CA
    Verify return code: 0 (ok)
```

# Example use cases
This section describes how the three configuration parameters `ca_certificate_path`, `ca_certificate_key_path` and `ca_certificate_chain_path` must be specified in the `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/config.yaml` DC/OS configuration file for the most common use cases of a custom CA certificate hierarchy.

## Use case 1: 
The signing certificate is a self-signed root certificate. The CA does not have a “parent” CA, hence the signing certificate chain is empty.

Provide the following files:

- on the bootstrap node:
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.crt` file containing the signing certificate
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.key` file containing the signing key

- on the master nodes:
    - `/var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/CA/private/custom_ca.key` file containing the signing key

Here is an example of the `issuer` and `subject` fields of a custom root Signing certificate:

```bash
cd $DCOS_INSTALL_DIR
openssl x509 -in genconf/dcos-ca.crt -issuer -subject -noout
```
```
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
```

Since the signing certificate is a root certificate and the corresponding signing certificate chain is empty, we must omit the `ca_certificate_chain_path` parameter in the DC/OS configuration file. Specify the configuration parameters as follows in the DC/OS configuration file on the bootstrap node:

```yaml
ca_certificate_path: genconf/dcos-ca.crt
ca_certificate_key_path: genconf/dcos-ca.key
```

## Use case 2: 

In this case the signing certificate is an intermediate one, issued directly by a root CA. The signing certificate chain consists of just the root CA certificate. Provide the following files:

- on the bootstrap node:
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.crt` file containing the signing certificate in PEM format
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.key` file containing the signing key
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt` file containing the root signing certificate in PEM format

- on the master nodes
    - `/var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/CA/private/custom_ca.key` file containing the signing key

Here is an example of an appropriate intermediate signing certificate:

```bash
cd $DCOS_INSTALL_DIR
openssl x509 -in genconf/dcos-ca.crt -issuer -subject -noout
```
```
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Intermediate CA 01
```

Here is an example of a corresponding signing certificate chain:  

```bash
cd $DCOS_INSTALL_DIR
cat genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt | awk -v cmd="openssl x509 -issuer -subject -noout && echo" '/-----BEGIN/ { c = $0; next } c { c = c "\n" $0 } /-----END/ { print c|cmd; close(cmd); c = 0 }'
```
```
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
```

Specify the configuration parameters as follows in the DC/OS configuration file on the bootstrap node:

```yaml
ca_certificate_path: genconf/dcos-ca.crt
ca_certificate_key_path: genconf/dcos-ca.key
ca_certificate_chain_path: genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt
```

## Use case 3: 

In this case the signing certificate is an intermediate one, issued directly by another intermediate CA that, in turn, has its certificate issued by a root CA.

The signing certificate chain comprises the 
1. signing certificate of the issuing intermediate CA, and 
1. the root CA 

in that order.

Provide the following files:

- on the bootstrap node:
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.crt` file containing the signing certificate
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca.key` file containing the signing key
    - `$DCOS_INSTALL_DIR/genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt` file containing the signing certificate chain

- on the master nodes
    - `/var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/CA/private/custom_ca.key` file containing the signing key

Here is an example of an appropriate custom intermediate signing certificate:

```bash
cd $DCOS_INSTALL_DIR
openssl x509 -in genconf/dcos-ca.crt -issuer -subject -noout
```
```
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Intermediate CA 01
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Intermediate CA 02
```

Here is an example of a corresponding signing certificate chain:

```bash
cd $DCOS_INSTALL_DIR
cat genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt | awk -v cmd="openssl x509 -issuer -subject -noout && echo" '/-----BEGIN/ { c = $0; next } c { c = c "\n" $0 } /-----END/ { print c|cmd; close(cmd); c = 0 }'
```
```
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Intermediate CA 01
issuer= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
subject= /C=US/L=Nebraska/O=Example/CN=Integration Test Root CA
```

Specify the configuration parameters as follows in the DC/OS configuration file on the bootstrap node:

```yaml
ca_certificate_path: genconf/dcos-ca.crt
ca_certificate_key_path: genconf/dcos-ca.key
ca_certificate_chain_path: genconf/dcos-ca-chain.crt
```
