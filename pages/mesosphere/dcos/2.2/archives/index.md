# Access archived versions of DC/OS documentation

In accordance with our [version policy](https://docs.d2iq.com/mesosphere/dcos/version-policy/), we regularly archive older, unsupported versions of our DC/OS documentation. This includes documentation for DC/OS 1.12 and below. You can still access older versions of DC/OS documentation on our [public github repo](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-docs-site/tree/archive/pages/mesosphere/dcos).
