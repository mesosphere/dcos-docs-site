excerpt: Creating and administering jobs using the web interface, the CLI, or the API
# beta: true
enterprise: false

You can create and administer jobs for the DC/OS cluster in any of the following ways:
- interactively with the DC/OS web-based administrative console GUI.
- interactively or programmatically with DC/OS command-line interface (CLI) programs.
- directly through calls to the DC/OS application programming interface (API) for job-related operations.

The DC/OS application programming interface (API) for job-related operations provides the underlying functionality that you can access through the DC/OS web-based administrative console and command-line interface (CLI). In most cases, therefore, you would only use the API directly if you are integrating the functionality with a custom program or automation script.

# Managing jobs with the DC/OS web-based interface
You can manage the most common job-related activity interactively through the DC/OS web-based interface. For example, you can add, modify, run, and remove jobs directly from the **Jobs** tab in the web-based console. However, the DC/OS web-based interface only provides access to a subset of the job-related functionality provided through the `dcos job` CLI and Jobs API. For more advanced job configurations and activity, use the [`dcos job`](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/cli/command-reference/dcos-job/) commands or the [Jobs API](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/deploying-jobs/quickstart/#jobs-api).

## Add a job
1. Navigate to the URL for the DC/OS web-based console in a web browser.

1. Click **Jobs**, then click **Create a Job** to display the New Job settings.

    ![Create JOB UI](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/img/GUI-Jobs-New_Job_Modal-1_12.png)

    You can configure the job using the fields displayed or click **JSON mode** to edit the JSON directly.

1. Click **General** to edit the most basic job settings, such as the job identifier, CPU, memory, and disk requirements.

    * **ID** - The ID of your job.
    * **Description** - A description of your job.
    * **CPUs** - The amount of CPU your job requires.
    * **Mem** - The amount of memory, in MB, your job requires.
    * **Disk space** - The amount of disk space, in MB, your job requires.
    * **Command** - The command your job will execute. Leave this blank if you will use a Docker image.

1. Click **Schedule**, then click **Run on a Schedule** to specify a schedule for when the job runs.

    After you select **Run on a Schedule**, you can use the following settings to define the schedule:
    - Select **Cron Schedule**  to specify the schedule in `cron` format. Use [this crontab generator](http://crontab.guru) for help.
    - Select **Time Zone**  to enter the time zone in [TZ format](http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/zonehelp), for example, America/New_York.
    - Select **Starting Deadline** to set the time, in seconds, to start the job if it misses its scheduled time for any reason. Missed job executions are counted as failed jobs.

    If you have defined a schedule, click **Enabled** to activate your schedule settings.

1. Click **Docker Container** to specify the Docker image for the new job, if you are using one.

    Optionally, you can select **privileged** to run the specified Docker image in privileged mode.

1. Click **Docker Parameters** to specify any additional Docker runtime parameters for the new job, if applicable.

    You can add multiple parameter names and corresponding values.

1. Click **Labels** to specify a **Label Name** and **Label Value** you want to attach as metadata to the new job. You can then use the job label to filter or expose information for labeled jobs. For more information about using labels, see [Labeling tasks and jobs](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/tutorials/task-labels/).

1. Verify that you have added the new job by clicking **Jobs**.

    ![Jobs List](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/img/GUI-Job-List.png)

## Add a job to a job group
You can add a job to a an existing job group or create a new job group when you create the job. Use dots in your job ID to nest the job in a group. For example, if you add a job using the job ID `marketing.myjob`, the new `myjob` is created in the `marketing` job group. In DC/OS Enterprise, you can use job groups to implement fine-grained user access. For more information about controlling access to jobs through job groups, see [Granting access to jobs](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/deploying-jobs/job-groups/).

## Modify, view, or remove a job
From the **Jobs** tab, click the name of your job and then the menu on the upper right to modify or delete it. While the job is running, you can click the job instance to drill down to **Details**, **Files**, and **Logs** data.

# Managing jobs with the DC/OS CLI
You can create and manage jobs from the DC/OS CLI using `dcos job` commands. To see a full list of available commands with usage information, run `dcos job --help`.

## Create a JSON file for a new job
1. Open a new file in a text editor to create a job file in JSON format.

1. In the new file, specify the basic parameters required to define the job, including the following:
    - the job `id` you use to manage the job
    - the specific command to run
    - the CPU, memory, and disk requirements
    - the job schedule

    For example, the JSON file for a new job might look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "myjob",
        "description": "A job that sleeps regularly",
        "run": {
            "cmd": "sleep 20000",
            "cpus": 0.01,
            "mem": 32,
            "disk": 0
        },
        "schedules": [
            {
                "id": "sleep-schedule",
                "enabled": true,
                "cron": "20 0 * * *",
                "concurrencyPolicy": "ALLOW"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Save the JSON file for the new job using an easily-identifiable file name. For example, you might save the job information as `mysleepjob.json`.

1. Add the job by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    dcos job add <myjob>.json
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    dcos job add mysleepjob.json
    ```
1. Verify that you have added the new job by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    dcos job list
    ```

## Concurrency policy for scheduled jobs
If you use a schedule to start a job, you can define a concurrency policy for the job. A concurrency policy determines whether a new job run instance is triggered if there's already a job instance running. 

For example, assume you have a job scheduled to start every day at 3:00AM, and you have set the concurrency policy for the job set to FORBID. If there is an instance of that job already running at 3:00AM--either because a previously-triggered job run is still active or has been triggered manually outside of the schedule--the scheduled start time will not trigger a new job to run. If there are no jobs running at the next scheduled start time, a new job instance starts and runs as scheduled.

If you want to allow scheduled jobs to be triggered while  other instances of the same job are running, you can set the `concurrencyPolicy` to ALLOW. 

Note: A `concurrencyPolicy` set to FORBID does *not* prevent you from starting a new job instance manually - for example via the API - even if one is already running. It only prevents a schedule to start a new job instance.

## MaxLaunchDelay
The `maxLaunchDelay` is a deprecated configuration option that is not used anymore

## Restart policy
Per default, metronome only tries to start a job instance once - the default restart policy is NEVER. The alternative is to set the restart policy to ON_FAILURE, which configures metronome to restart the task until it completes successfully or the `activeDeadlineSeconds` is reached.

If no `activeDeadlineSeconds` is defined, metronome tries restarting the task indefinitely, which may lead to issues if the task will never complete successfully - it is advised to always set an `activeDeadlineSeconds`.

```json
{
  ...
  "run" : {
    "cpus" : 0.01,
    "mem" : 32,
    "disk" : 0,
    "cmd" : "sleep 60",
    "restart" : {
      "policy" : "ON_FAILURE",
      "activeDeadlineSeconds" : 30
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## TaskKillGracePeriod
The `taskKillGracePeriodSeconds` can be used to define the time between the SIGTERM and SIGKILL that is send to a task on stop. See Marathons documentation on `taskKillGracePeriodSeconds` for more information

```json
{
  ...
  "run" : {
    "cpus" : 0.01,
    "mem" : 32,
    "disk" : 0,
    "cmd" : "sleep 60",
    "taskKillGracePeriodSeconds" : 30
  },
  ...
}
```

## Create a schedule-only JSON file
If you specify a schedule for a job in the JSON file for that job, you can assign only one schedule for the job to run under.

If you want to use the same schedule for more than one job, however, you can create a separate JSON file specifically for the schedule. You can then use the `dcos job schedule add <job-id> <schedule-file>` command to associate a job with the schedule.

1. Open a file in a text editor to [create a new job](#cli-add-job) file in JSON format, if necessary.

    You must use the job `id` you define for the job to associate a schedule JSON file with the job. To prevent schedule conflicts or unexpected job runs, you should not define schedule parameters for a job if you want to use the schedule-only JSON file to control when a job runs.

1. Open a new file in a text editor to create the schedule you want to use in JSON format.

    For example, the JSON file for a new schedule might look similar to this:

    ```json
    {
        "concurrencyPolicy": "ALLOW",
        "cron": "20 0 * * *",
        "enabled": true,
        "id": "nightly",
        "nextRunAt": "2016-07-26T00:20:00.000+0000",
        "startingDeadlineSeconds": 900,
        "timezone": "UTC"
    }
    ```

1. Save the JSON file for the new schedule using an easily-identifiable file name. For example, you might save the schedule information as `my-cron-def.json`.

1. Associate the job with the schedule by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    dcos job schedule add <job-id> <schedule-file>
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    dcos job schedule add mytestjob my-cron-def.json
    ```

1. Verify that you have added the new job schedule by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    dcos job list
    ```

## Start a job from the command line
You can trigger a job to run:
- manually on-demand
- automatically based on a schedule you have defined
- programmatically through automation with or without a schedule

You can use any of these approaches to start a job instance that is referred to as a job run. For example, you can use the DC/OS command-line interface to start jobs regardless of whether you have defined a schedule or not. Starting a job manually from the command-line is similar to starting a job by clicking **Run now** using the DC/OS web-based console.

To start a job run on-demand outside of any scheduled job activity, run a command similar to the following:

```bash
dcos job run <job-id>
```

For example, if the job id is `mytestjob`, run:

```bash
dcos job run mytestjob
```

Starting a job manually from the command-line or through the DC/OS web-based console triggers a new job run each time the command is executed. Jobs that are triggered manually on-demand ignore concurrency policy settings.

If a schedule is used to start a job, however, the job's concurrency policy determines whether a new job run instance is triggered. Being able to control whether jobs run concurrently is one of the main differences between triggering a job to run manually or using a schedule.

## Remove a job from the command line
You can remove a job using the command-line program dcos job remove <job-id> as long as the job does not have any active job instances running. If a job has any currently active running instances, you must stop all of the currently-active jobs. After you stop all running job instances, you can remove the job using the `dcos job remove <job-id>` command.

To remove a job:
1. Check the status of active jobs by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    dcos job list
    ```

1. Stop all running job instances for the job you want to delete and remove the job by running the following command:

    ```bash
    dcos job remove <job-id> --stop-current-job-runs
    ```

1. Verify that you have removed the specified job by running the following command:

    ```
    dcos job list
    ```

## Modify a job from the command line
To modify an existing job:
1. Open JSON file for the job in a text editor.

1. Edit the JSON file for the job to specify the changes you want to make.

1. Save the file, then run the following command to use the updated job information:

```bash
dcos job update <job-file>.json
```

### Modify a job's schedule
You can update the schedule of your job in two ways, depending if your job has a schedule specified in the `<job-file>.json` or if your job's schedule is kept in a separate file.

#### Modify a job with a schedule

Modify the `schedules` parameter of your `<job-file>.json`. Then run

```
dcos job update <job-file>.json
```

#### Modify a job with a separate schedule file
Modify `<schedule-file>.json`. Then, run one of the following commands:

```bash
dcos job schedule add <job-id> <schedule-file>.json
dcos job schedule remove <job-id> <schedule-id>
dcos job schedule update <job-id> <schedule-file>.json
```

## View job details
List all jobs:

```
dcos job list
```

List all previous runs of your job:

```
dcos job history <job-id>
```

To view details about your job, run:

```
dcos job show <job-id>
```

To view details about your job's schedule, run:

```
dcos job schedule show <job-id>
```

### View job logs
To view the log for your job:

```
dcos task log --completed <job-id>
```

To get the log for only a specific job run, use a job run ID from `dcos job history <job-id>`

```
dcos task log --completed <job-run-id>
```

# <a name="jobs-api"></a>Using the Jobs API
You can also create and administer jobs through calls to the Jobs API endpoints. This section highlights the most common tasks you perform through job-related API calls. For more complete information about the Jobs API, see the  [Jobs API reference](http://dcos.github.io/metronome/docs/generated/api.html) information.

The code examples in this section illustrate how to include Jobs API calls to perform job-related tasks with the client URL (cURL) program. For detailed information about using `curl` command, see the [`curl` man page](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html).

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>The DC/OS CLI and web-based console support a combined JSON format (accessed using the <code>/v0</code> endpoint) that allows you to specify a schedule in the job descriptor. To schedule a job using the API, use two calls: one to add an unscheduled job, and another to associate a <code><schedule-file>.json</code> with the job.</p>

## Add a job using an API call
The following command adds a job called `myjob.json`.

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs -d@/Users/<your-username>/<myjob>.json
```

## Remove a job using an API call
The following command removes a job regardless of whether the job is running:
```
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs/<myjob>?stopCurrentJobRuns=true
```

To remove a job only if it is not running, set `stopCurrentJobRuns` to `False`.

## Modify or view a job using an API call
The following command shows all jobs:

```
curl -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs
```

The following command lists job runs:

```
curl -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" "$(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs/<myjob>/runs/"
```

Stop a run with the following command:

```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" "$(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs/<myjob>/runs/20160725212507ghwfZ/actions/stop"
```

<a name="add-sched"></a>

## Add a schedule to a job
The following command adds a schedule to a job:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs/<job-id>/schedules -d@<schedule-file>.json
```

## Start a job using an API call
You can use the DC/OS API to start jobs programmatically. Similar to starting a job using the web-based console or command-line interface, you must specify the job identifer in the call.

To trigger a job run to start you can use a REST API call similar to the following:

```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/service/metronome/v1/jobs/{jobId}/runs
```
