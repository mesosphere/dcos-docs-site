# Installing a service using the CLI

The general syntax for installing a service with the CLI follows.

```bash
dcos package install [--options=<config-file-name>.json] <servicename>
```

Use the optional `--options` flag to specify the name of the customized JSON file you created in [advanced configuration](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/deploying-services/config-universe-service/).

For example, you would use the following command to install Chronos with the default parameters.

```bash
dcos package install chronos
```

# Installing a service using the GUI

From the DC/OS GUI you can install services from the **Services** or **Catalog** tab. The **Catalog** tab shows all of the available DC/OS services from the package [repositories](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/administering-clusters/repo/). The **Services** tab provides a full featured interface to the native DC/OS Marathon instance.


## Catalog tab

1.  Navigate to the [**Catalog**](/mesosphere/dcos/1.12/gui/catalog/) tab in the DC/OS GUI.

Figure 3. Service is running

Some services from the **Community** section of the Catalog will not show up in the DC/OS service listing. For these, inspect the service's Marathon app in the Marathon GUI to verify that the service is running and healthy.
