# Upgrading Your Cluster

Terraform also makes it easy to upgrade our cluster to a newer version of DC/OS. If you are interested in learning more about the upgrade procedure that Terraform performs, please see the official [DC/OS Upgrade documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/{{ model.folder_version }}/installing/production/upgrading/).

1. In order to perform an upgrade, we need to go back to our `main.tf` and modify the current DC/OS Version (`dcos_version`) to a newer version, such as `1.13.3` for this example.

    ```bash
    dcos_version = "1.13.3"
    ```
2.  We also should make sure having the latest version of the Terraform modules. So we tell Terraform to request those from the registry.

    ```bash
    terraform get -update
    ```

3. Re-run the execution plan, terraform will notice the change in version and run accordingly.

    ```bash
    terraform plan -out=plan.out
    ```

    You should see an output like below, with your `main.tf` now set for normal operations on a new version of DC/OS.

4. Apply the plan.

    ```bash
    terraform apply plan.out
    ```

    Once the apply completes, you can verify that the cluster was upgraded via the DC/OS UI.
