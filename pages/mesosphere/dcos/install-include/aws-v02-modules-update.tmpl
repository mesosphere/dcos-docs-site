## Universal Installer 0.2 update for AWS
The Universal Installer config module backend has undergone a change and is now running version `0.2` for Amazon Web Services users. If you are still on `0.1`, there is no direct upgrade path you will NOT be able to upgrade automatically, as the underlying cluster management has been changed. You will need to spin up a new cluster and transfer your services over.

Updates:
- Currently, only CentOS or RHEL are the only supported node OS's.
- `dcos_install_mode` has been deprecated and is now automatically calculated.

#### Checking your version
You can check the version of the Universal Installer modules you are running by viewing your `main.tf`.

```hcl
module "dcos" {
    source  = "dcos-terraform/dcos/aws"
    version = "~> 0.2.0"
    # ...
}
```

#### Using install and upgrade modes for `~> 0.1.0` version users
To use the examples on these pages, make the following changes to your `main.tf`. The only time you should set the variable to `upgrade` is when upgrading the DC/OS version. Remember to set it back to install afterwards to ensure normal operations.

```hcl
variable "dcos_install_mode" {
  description = "specifies which type of command to execute. Options: install or upgrade"
  default = "install"
}

module "dcos" {
  source  = "dcos-terraform/dcos/aws"
  version = "~> 0.1.0"

  # ...

  # Reads the install mode set above
  dcos_install_mode = "${var.dcos_install_mode}"
}
```
