# Set up SSH credentials for your cluster

Terraform will need to send out SSH keys to connect securely to the nodes it creates. If you already have a key-pair available and added to your SSH-agent, you can skip this section.

1. Not sure if you have a keypair you want to use? List the contents of your ssh directory.

    ```bash
    ls ~/.ssh
    ```

1. If you don't have one you like, start the ssh-keygen program to create a new key pair, following the prompts.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

1. Add the key to your SSH agent by starting the agent if it isn't already running and then loading your key:

    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/<your-key-name>
    ```
