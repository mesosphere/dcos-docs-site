# Setting up a cluster

In order to interact with your cluster, you first need to set up the CLI.

```bash
dcos cluster setup <cluster-url>
```

After following the login procedure, your CLI is now ready to interact with your cluster. You will notice that it now has additional commands such as `marathon`, `node`, `package` etc. These commands come from the [plugins](/mesosphere/dcos/1.14/cli/plugins/), dcos-core-cli and, if applicable, dcos-enterprise-cli, which is automatically installed as part of the setup command.

To display the DC/OS CLI version, run:

```bash
dcos --version
```

# Listing your clusters

The DC/OS CLI can work with multiple clusters. The following command displays the latest configured cluster:

```bash
$ dcos cluster list
        NAME               ID                        STATUS     VERSION      URL
  *   cluster 26f72c2f-8d03-47d7-b95f-972b1fd3dea2  AVAILABLE    1.13  <cluster-url>
```

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>The * indicates that the CLI is currently attached to the cluster name. If you run the setup command again with another cluster, you will see a new item in the list.</p>

# DC/OS CLI versions and configuration files

The DC/OS CLI has a configuration file for each connected cluster, which by default is stored in `~/.dcos/clusters/<cluster_id>/dcos.toml`. You can optionally change the base portion (`~/.dcos`) of the configuration directory using the [`DCOS_DIR`](#dcos-cdir) environment variable.
