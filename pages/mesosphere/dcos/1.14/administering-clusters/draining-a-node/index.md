You can drain tasks from an agent node in an active DC/OS cluster in order to take the node down for maintenance or to remove it permanently from the cluster. Nodes may be drained and their progress may be monitored via the DC/OS CLI or UI.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>All tasks that are running on the agent will be killed when draining is initiated. Use this feature with caution!</p>
<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>When the <code>--decommission</code> option is specified, all local persistent data on the node will be lost!</p>

Initiating draining will cause all tasks on the target agent node to receive a kill event immediately, assuming the agent is currently reachable. If the agent is unreachable, initiation of the kill event will be delayed until the agent is reachable by the master again. When the tasks receive a kill event, a SIGTERM signal will be sent to the task to begin the killing process. Depending on the particular task's behavior, this signal may be sufficient to terminate it. Some tasks may use this signal to begin the process of graceful termination, which may take some time. After some delay, a SIGKILL signal will be sent to the task, which forcefully terminates the task if it is still running. The delay between the SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals is determined by the length of the task's kill grace period. If no grace period is set for the task, a default value of several seconds will be used depending on configuration.

### Prerequisites:

*   [DC/OS CLI installed and configured](/mesosphere/dcos/1.14/cli/).
*   Sufficient [permissions](/mesosphere/dcos/1.14/security/ent/perms-reference) to drain nodes (Enterprise DC/OS only).

### Maximum Grace Period

It is possible to set a max grace period when draining, which sets an upper bound on the duration of the kill grace period. When this is set, the minimum of the task's grace period and the max grace period will be used when killing the task.

### Decommissioning an Agent After Draining

In some cases, such as autoscaled cloud instances which are later scaled down, you may know that after the node is drained and taken down, it will never come back again. Each agent node is uniquely identified by metadata on its hard disk, so even if other instances are scaled up in the future, if they don't retain the persisted metadata of the previous instances, they are viewed as new nodes by the DC/OS cluster.

In cases where the unique agent will not return after it is drained and removed from the cluster, you can specify an option which will automatically decommission the node after it has finished draining, which removes the agent's metadata from the cluster. If this option is not specified, the cluster will remember the agent node in case it reregisters with the cluster later on.

## Draining with the CLI

To drain a node with the DC/OS CLI, first locate the Mesos agent ID for the node in the `ID` column of the following command's output:

```bash
dcos node list
```

Then use that ID with the `dcos node drain` command:

```bash
dcos node drain <mesos-agent-id>
```

The maximum grace period and/or decommission options may be specified like so:

```bash
dcos node drain <mesos-agent-id> --max-grace-period=10m --decommission
```

Once draining on an agent has begun, you can monitor the tasks on that node by running:

```bash
dcos task list --agent-id=<mesos-agent-id>
```

Overall progress of draining on the node may be monitored with the following command:

```bash
dcos node list --mesos-id=<mesos-agent-id>
```

Locate the `STATUS` field: the usual status of a node will be `ACTIVE`. When draining is initiated on the node, it will transition to `DRAINING`. Once all tasks have been killed and their terminal status updates have been acknowledged by the relevant services, and once all resource operations on the node have finished, it will transition to `DRAINED`. When the node is in the `DRAINED` state, draining is complete.

If the `--decommission` option was included in the initial drain command, the node's metadata will be automatically removed from the cluster when draining is complete. It's important to note that decommissioning the node will also cause all local persistent data on that node to be lost. If the decommission option is not specified, the cluster will wait for the node to be manually reactivated when any planned maintenance or other update procedures are finished.

Before performing maintenance, stop the `dcos-mesos-slave` systemd unit (or `dcos-mesos-slave-public` for public agents) on the node so that the agent no longer attempts to register with the master:

```bash
systemctl stop dcos-mesos-slave
```

## Reactivating an Agent Node After Maintenance

When maintenance is complete and you are ready to reactivate the node and allow it to rejoin the cluster, you may do so with the following command:

```bash
dcos node reactivate <mesos-agent-id>
```

Then start the `dcos-mesos-slave` systemd unit (or `dcos-mesos-slave-public` for public agents) by executing the following command on the node, and the agent will rejoin the cluster:

```bash
systemctl start dcos-mesos-slave
```

## Monitoring Draining with the UI

You may also monitor the draining of an agent via the DC/OS UI. To do so, navigate to the `Nodes` overview pane. The `Status` column will list either `Active`, `Draining`, or `Drained`, similar to the output of the CLI's `node list` command.

## Notes Regarding Node Draining

Once draining is initiated on an agent node, it cannot be cancelled. This command should be used with caution, especially if executed with the `--decommission` option, as this results in the node's permanent removal from the cluster when draining is complete.

If a node becomes stuck in the `DRAINING` state and does not transition to `DRAINED` after the expected duration (either the duration specified in the `--max-grace-period` argument, or the longest kill grace period of the tasks running on the node), then it should be inspected to determine the cause. It is not necessary to issue the `dcos node drain` command again once a node is in the `DRAINING` state; this will have no effect. If all tasks on the node have terminated, then it's possible that either a terminal task status update has not been acknowledged by the relevant service, or a resource operation on that node has not finished. To rule out the former, inspect the relevant services which were running tasks on the node and ensure that they are running and available. You can list the tasks on the node to discover which services may not have acknowledged their terminal updates:

```bash
dcos task list --agent-id=<mesos-agent-id>
```

To rule out the latter, the [`GET_OPERATIONS`](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/operator-http-api/#get_operations-1) call may be used on the agent node in order to inspect any currently-pending resource operations. If a resource operation is still in the `Pending` state, the operation may be long-running and take some time to complete, or it may be stuck due to some issue with the storage backend which is actually performing the operation.

## Draining an Agent Node Manually

While the automatic draining procedure described above is likely sufficient for most use cases, it is also possible to drain a node manually when more control over the draining process is required. To do this, first deactivate the node:

```bash
dcos node deactivate <mesos-agent-id>
```

This will stop any new workloads from being launched on that agent. At this point, the APIs exposed by individual services may be used to kill any tasks running on the node. For example, for typical apps and pods launched via the DC/OS UI, the [API of the Marathon container orchestrator](/mesosphere/dcos/1.14/deploying-services/marathon-api/) can be used to terminate the associated tasks. Once all tasks on the node have been killed, it can be taken down for maintenance, and then reactivated once maintenance is complete:

```bash
dcos node reactivate <mesos-agent-id>
```
