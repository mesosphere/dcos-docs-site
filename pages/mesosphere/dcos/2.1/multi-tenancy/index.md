Groups enable you to use logical collections to allocate and restrict resource consumption for a specific team, project, or Line of Business.
To support multi-tenancy, you can reserve and prioritize resources using roles, reservations, quotas, and weights.
Quotas enable multi-tenancy by allowing you to specify the maximum resources that the services in a particular group can use.
