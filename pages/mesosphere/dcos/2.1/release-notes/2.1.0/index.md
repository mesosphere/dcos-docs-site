Mesosphere&reg; DC/OS&trade; 2.1.0 was released on 9, June 2020.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Upgrading from DC/OS 2.1.x to DC/OS 2.2.0 causes all Docker containers, launched by Docker Containerizer, in any cluster to be restarted due to an issue that changes the name of the 'libnetwork' certificate. Because of this, we recommend you upgrade directly to [DC/OS 2.2.1](mesosphere/dcos/2.2/release-notes/2.2.1/).</p>

# Release Summary
DC/OS is a distributed operating system that enables you to manage resources, application deployment, data services, networking, and security in an on-premise, cloud, or hybrid cluster environment.

This release provides new features and enhancements to improve the user experience, fix reported issues, integrate changes from previous releases, and maintain compatibility and support for other packages, such as Marathon and Metronome, used in DC/OS.

# New Features and Capabilities 

## Vertical Container Bursting
DC/OS now allows you to set a limit on the amount of CPUs and memory used by Marathon apps and pods. This means that services can run with a guaranteed amount of CPU and memory, while being allowed to consume up to a greater amount of these resources when free CPU cycles and/or memory is available. For more information, see [Creating Services](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/deploying-services/creating-services/).

## Network Policies with Calico
Calico is now pre-installed in DC/OS 2.1 and can be used by containers to join overlay networks and set network policies. The DC/OS Calico component integrates Calico networking into DC/OS, providing the Calico CNI plug-in for Mesos Universal Container Runtime and the Calico libnetwork plug-in for Docker Engine. For more information, see [Calico](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/networking/SDN/calico).

## Jobs Virtual Networking Support
Metronome based jobs can now join container networks to communicate with other services/jobs in the same network. For more information, see [Creating Jobs](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/deploying-jobs/quickstart/).

## Custom Certificates for Admin Router
DC/OS now allows you to provide a non-CA custom external certificate and key that the Admin Router will then use for clients connecting to a cluster. For more information, see [Configuring a Custom External Certificate](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/security/ent/tls-ssl/ar-custom/)

## Domain Sockets for Agent Executor Communication
Added a new configuration option `mesos_http_executors_domain_sockets`, which will cause the mesos-agent to use domain sockets when communicating with executors (default is enabled). This change allows administrators to write firewall rules blocking unauthorized access to the agent port 5051 since access to this will not be required anymore for executors to work.

# Breaking changes
- Docker Hub announced an [update](https://www.docker.com/blog/scaling-docker-to-serve-millions-more-developers-network-egress/) to their image pull policies in August 2020. The change results in the need to change cluster configurations to accommodate new account structures that enable image pull rate limiting.

  Rate limiting happens on a per-pull basis regardless of whether the pulled image is owned by a paid user. This means D2iQ, as owner of most images used in Mesosphere® DC/OS®, does not have any influence as to whether your current address is rate-limited or not. Mesosphere DC/OS does not have a strict dependency on Docker Hub accounts or plans.

  Without any further configuration, your cluster is likely using the “Free plan - anonymous users” tier. This means that if each of your nodes has its own public IP address, you can do 100 image pulls per 6 hours on every node. While this should not be a problem with just a few, usually-healthy workloads, but you may encounter unforeseeable issues if you:

    - Have constantly failing tasks
    - Are running a large number of CI jobs
    - Have metronome tasks with different containers
    - Use the [docker.forcePullImage](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker.html#forcing-a-docker-pull) option

  In the worst case, your cluster might not be able to reschedule a failed task for up to 6 hours, which could lead to unresponsive services or even data corruption, for example, when using clustered databases.

  The DC/OS software offers several ways to specify these credentials:

    1. Cluster-wide credentials using dcos-config.yml: [Using Docker credentials to set cluster-wide registry credentials](https://docs.d2iq.com/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/deploying-services/private-docker-registry/#using-cluster-docker-credentials-to-set-cluster-wide-registry-credentials)

    1. Task-specific credentials using secrets: [Reference private docker registry credentials in DC/OS secrets](https://docs.d2iq.com/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/deploying-services/private-docker-registry/#reference-private-docker-registry-credentials-in-dcos-secrets-enterprise)

  A non-DC/OS-specific way to specify the Docker credentials is to use the .docker/config.json file on each agent, as described here: 
[Create a Docker credentials configuration file](https://docs.d2iq.com/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/deploying-services/private-docker-registry/#create-a-docker-credentials-configuration-file)

- The configuration option `MARATHON_ACCEPTED_RESOURCE_ROLES_DEFAULT_BEHAVIOR` replaces the config option `MARATHON_DEFAULT_ACCEPTED_RESOURCE_ROLES`. Please see the Marathon [command-line flag documentation](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/docs/docs/command-line-flags.md) for a description of the flag.
- Removal of`revive_offers_for_new_apps` Marathon option.
- Marathon no longer sanitizes the field `acceptedResourceRoles`. The field is an array of one or two values: `*` and the service role. Previously, when an invalid value was provided, Marathon would silently drop it. Now, it returns an error. If this causes a disruption, you can re-enable this feature by adding `MARATHON_DEPRECATED_FEATURES=sanitize_accepted_resource_roles` to the file `/var/lib/dcos/marathon/environment` on all masters. You must remove this line before upgrading to the next version of DC/OS.
- DC/OS Net now waits until agents become active before adding DNS entries for tasks on the agent to prevent resolving to unreachable addresses. (DCOS_OSS-5463)
- dcos-net (l4lb) allows for graceful shutdown of connections by changing the VIP backend weight to 0 when tasks are unhealthy or enter the TASK_KILLING state instead of removing them. (D2IQ-61077)
- Removed the spartan package from DC/OS. Is was deprecated in 1.11 and replaced by dcos-net.
- Removed the toybox package from DC/OS. Is was used only by Spartan.
- Removed the dcos-history-service from DC/OS. (DCOS-58529)
- New format for Admin Router access logs. (D2IQ-43957, DCOS-59598, D2IQ-62839)
