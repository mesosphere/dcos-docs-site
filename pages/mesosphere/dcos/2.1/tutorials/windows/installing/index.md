## About the Mesosphere Universal Installer

Use the [Mesosphere Universal Installer](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/installing/evaluation/)  to deploy DC/OS on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure Resource Manager (AzureRM). The Mesosphere Universal Installer is built on top of Terraform, an open source infrastructure automation tool which uses templates to manage infrastructure for multiple public cloud providers, service providers, and on-premises solutions. Through the Mesosphere Universal Installer you can quickly and easily create your infrastructure, configures resources, and manage communication between agents. Operations such as scaling a cluster or upgrading to a newer version of DC/OS are now incredibly easy. Getting started templates allow for a quick installation of DC/OS, yet can be expanded into a full production environment including upgrades, without ever taking down your cluster.


## On-Prem Installation

The [On-Prem Installation](/mesosphere/dcos/2.1/tutorials/windows/installing/onprem/) is used to install the Mixed OS cluster of DC/OS for datacenters. It involves packaging the DC/OS distribution and connecting to every node manually to run the DC/OS installation commands.
