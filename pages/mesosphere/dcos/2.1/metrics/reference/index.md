Mesosphere DC/OS collects basic system metrics--such as CPU and memory--for nodes and containers automatically. Mesosphere DC/OS also collects metadata about the different categories of metrics. For more information about the metadata metrics, see [Dimensions](#Dimensions).

You should note that automatically-collected metrics are only available for containers that provide endpoint statistics. For example, Docker containers do not provide networking data for DC/OS to consume, so the networking metrics that are available for UCR containers are not available for Docker containers.
