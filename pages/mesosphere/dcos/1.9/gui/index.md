The DC/OS web interface provides a rich graphical view of your DC/OS cluster. With the web interface you can view the current state of your entire cluster and DC/OS services. The web interface is installed as a part of your DC/OS installation.

Additionally, there is a User Menu on the upper-left side of the web interface that includes links for documentation, CLI installation, and user sign out.
