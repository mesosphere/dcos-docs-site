# Marathon Properties

### acceptedResourceRoles
A list of resource roles. If not specified, all resource offers are accepted. For more information, see the [Mesos documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/roles/).

### args
An array of strings that specifies the command to run. The `args` field may be used in place of `cmd` even when using the default command executor. 

**Important:** You must specify either `cmd` or `args` in all app definitions. It is invalid to supply both `cmd` and `args` in the same app.

### backoffFactor
The multiplicand to apply to the `backoffSeconds` value. The default value is `1.15`. The `backoffSeconds` and `backoffFactor` values are multiplied until they reach the `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` value. After they reach that value, Marathon waits `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` before repeating this cycle exponentially. For example, if `backoffSeconds: 3`, `backoffFactor: 2`, and `maxLaunchDelaySeconds: 3600`, there will be ten attempts to launch a failed task, each three seconds apart. After these ten attempts, Marathon will wait 3600 seconds before repeating this cycle.

This prevents sandboxes associated with consecutively failing tasks from filling up the hard disk on Mesos slaves. This applies also to tasks that are killed due to failing too many health checks.

### backoffSeconds
The amount of time (in seconds) before Marathon retries launching a failed task. The default is `1`. The `backoffSeconds` and `backoffFactor` values are multiplied until they reach the `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` value. After they reach that value, Marathon waits `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` before repeating this cycle exponentially. For example, if `backoffSeconds: 3`, `backoffFactor: 2`, and `maxLaunchDelaySeconds: 3600`, there will be ten attempts to launch a failed task, each three seconds apart. After these ten attempts, Marathon will wait 3600 seconds before repeating this cycle.

This prevents sandboxes associated with consecutively failing tasks from filling up the hard disk on Mesos slaves. This applies also to tasks that are killed due to failing too many health checks.

### cmd
The command that is executed. This value is wrapped by Mesos via `/bin/sh -c ${app.cmd}`. 

**Important:** You must specify either `cmd` or `args` in all app definitions. It is invalid to supply both `cmd` and `args` in the same app.

### constraints
Specifies constraint operators which control where apps can run, to optimize for either fault tolerance or locality. For more information, see the [Constraints documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/constraints.html).

### container
The container information. 

- **type** The containerizer type, either `MESOS` or `DOCKER`. For more information, see the [Containerizers documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/deploying-services/containerizers/). 
- **docker** The Docker container information.
    
    - **image** The path to the Docker image.
    - **network** The networking type, either `HOST`, `BRIDGE`, or `USER`. For more information, see the [Docker networking documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/).
    - **portMappings** The port mappings between host and container.  A port mapping is a tuple that contains a host port (`hostPort`), container port (`containerPort`), service port (`servicePort`), and protocol (`protocol`).  Port mappings are similar to passing `-p` into the Docker command line to specify a relationship between a port on the host machine and a port inside the container. 
    
        - **containerPort** The container port (e.g., `8080`).
        - **hostPort** The host port (e.g., `0`). The default value is `0`. In `USER` mode, the hostPort is not required, but if left unspecified Marathon will not randomly allocate a port.
        - **servicePort** The service port (e.g., `9000`).
        - **protocol** The HTTP protocol, either `tcp` or `udp`.
        
    - **privileged** Whether to give extended privileges to this container. For more information, see the [Docker run command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).
    
      - `"privileged": false` Do not give extended privileges. This is the default value.
      - `"privileged": true` Give extended privileges. 
      
    - **parameters** Specify command-line options for the `docker run` command executed by the Mesos containerizer. Parameters passed in this manner are not guaranteed to be supported in the future, as Mesos may not always interact with Docker via the CLI.
    
- **volumes** The persistent volume.  
 
    - **containerPath** The path where your application will read and write data. This must be a single-level path relative to the container; it cannot contain a forward slash (`/`). (`"data"`, but not `"/data"`, `"/var/data"` or `"var/data"`). If your application requires an absolute path, or a relative path with slashes, [use this configuration](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/storage/persistent-volume/#abs-paths).
    - **external** The external volume. For more information, see the [documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/storage/external-storage/).
        
        - **name** Name that your volume driver uses to look up your volume.
        - **provider** The storage provider.
        - **options** Specifies which Docker volume driver to use for storage. The only Docker volume driver provided with [DC/OS is REX-Ray](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/storage/external-storage/). 
        - **size** The size (in GiB) of the external volume. 
        
    - **hostPath** The host path.
    - **mode** The access mode of the volume, either read-write (`RW`) or read-only (`RO`). 
    - **persistent** The local persistent volume. For more information, see the [documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/storage/persistent-volume/).
        
        - **size** The size (in MiBs) of the persistent volume. 
    
### cpus
The number of required CPUs per instance. This number does not have to be integer, but can be a fraction.    

### dependencies
A list of dependent services for an application. The order is derived from the dependencies to start, stop, and upgrade of the application. For example, if application `/a` relies on the services `/b` which relies on `/c`. To start all 3 applications, first `/c` is started, then `/b` and `/a`.

### env
Specifies environment variables.

### executor
The executor used to launch the application. The default is `//cmd`, which takes the `cmd` and executes that on the shell level.

### fetch
The list of URIs to fetch. For more information, see the [Mesos Fetcher documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/fetcher/).

- **uri** URI to be fetched by Mesos fetcher module.
- **executable** Set fetched artifact as executable.
- **extract** Extract fetched artifact if supported by Mesos fetcher module.
- **cache** Cache fetched artifact, if supported by Mesos fetcher module.

### healthChecks
An array of checks that are run against an application’s tasks. Marathon health checks perform periodic checks on the containers distributed across a cluster to make sure they’re up and responding. For more information, see the [Health Checks documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/deploying-services/creating-services/health-checks/).

- **gracePeriodSeconds** Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to ignore health checks immediately after a task is started; or until the task becomes healthy for the first time.
- **intervalSeconds** Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to wait between health checks.
- **maxConsecutiveFailures** Specifies the number of consecutive health check failures that can occur before a task is killed.
- **path** If `"protocol": "HTTP"`, this option specifies the path to the task health status endpoint. For example, `“/path/to/health”`.
- **portIndex** Specifies the port index in the ports array that is used for health requests. A port index allows the app to use any port, such as `“[0, 0, 0]”` and tasks could be started with port environment variables such as `$PORT1`.
- **protocol** Specifies the protocol of the requests: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `TCP`, or `Command`.
- **timeoutSeconds** Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) before a health check fails, regardless of the response.

### id
(Required) Unique identifier for the app consisting of a series of names separated by slashes. Each name must be at least 1 character and may only contain digits (0-9), dashes (-), dots (.), and lowercase letters (a-z). The name may not begin or end with a dash.

The allowable format is represented by the following regular expression:

```
^(([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-]*[a-z0-9])\\.)*([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\\-]*[a-z0-9])$
```

### instances
The number of instances. You can change this number as needed to scale the application.

### ipAddress
Declares that your application will use [virtual networking](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/networking/load-balancing-vips/virtual-networks/).

- **groups** The name of logically-related interfaces that are allowed to communicate among themselves. Network traffic is allowed between two container interfaces that share at least one network group. For example, you can create separate groups for isolating development, testing, quality assurance, production, and deployment environments.
- **labels** Metadata to be used by Isolator or IPAM (e.g., rack).
- **networkName** Name of the network that Mesos uses to determine the network that the container joins. It is up to Mesos to decide how to interpret this field. If `ipAddress` is defined and `networkName` is not, then the value of `networkName` defaults to the value of the default_network_name command-line flag (if specified).

### labels
Attach metadata to apps  to expose additional information to other services. For example, you could label apps `"environment": "staging"` to mark services by their position in the pipeline.

### maxLaunchDelaySeconds
The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait, after applying the `backoffSeconds` and `backoffFactor` values, before attempting to restart failed tasks. The `backoffSeconds` and `backoffFactor` values are multiplied until they reach the `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` value. After they reach that value, Marathon waits `maxLaunchDelaySeconds` before repeating this cycle exponentially. For example, if `backoffSeconds: 3`, `backoffFactor: 2`, and `maxLaunchDelaySeconds: 3600`, there will be ten attempts to launch a failed task, each three seconds apart. After these ten attempts, Marathon will wait 3600 seconds before repeating this cycle.

This prevents sandboxes associated with consecutively failing tasks from filling up the hard disk on Mesos slaves. This applies also to tasks that are killed due to failing too many health checks.

### mem
The amount of memory (MB) required per instance.

### portsDefinitions
An array of required port resources on the host. The portDefinitions array serves multiple roles:

- Determines how many dynamic ports are allocated for each task.
- For every port that is zero, a globally unique (cluster-wide) port is assigned and provided as part of the app definition to be used in load balancing definitions. For more information, see the [Networking documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/networking/).

Each port value is exposed to the instance via environment variables `$PORT0`, `$PORT1`, etc. Ports assigned to running instances are also available via the task resource.

**Recommendations:**

- Configure ports assignment for Docker containers for `BRIDGE` and `USER` networking in `container.docker.portMappings`.
- If you use the Mesos Containerizer, pass zeros as port values to generate one or more arbitrary free ports for each application instance.

For more information, see the [Containerizers](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/deploying-services/containerizers/) and [Service Ports](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/deploying-services/service-ports/) documentation.

### requirePorts
Whether the host ports of your tasks are automatically assigned. 

- `"requirePorts": false` Ports are automatically assigned. 
- `"requirePorts": true` Manually specify ports in advance. Marathon will only schedule the associated tasks on hosts that have the specified ports available. 

### residency
Set up a stateful application. For more information, see the [local persistent volumes documentation](/mesosphere/dcos/1.9/storage/persistent-volume/).

- **taskLostBehavior** Indicates whether Marathon will launch the task on another node after receiving a `TASK_LOST` status update.

    - **WAIT_FOREVER** Do not relaunch the task after receiving a `TASK_LOST` status update. This setting is required to create a persistent volume. This is the default value.
    - **RELAUNCH_AFTER_TIMEOUT** Relaunch the task after receiving a `TASK_LOST` status update.

### taskKillGracePeriodSeconds
The amount of time (in seconds) between the executor sending SIGTERM to a task and then sending SIGKILL. 

### upgradeStrategy
Specifies how Marathon stops old versions and launches new versions. During an upgrade all instances of an application get replaced by a new version. 

- **minimumHealthCapacity** The minimum percentage (expressed as a decimal fraction between `0.0` and `1.0`) of nodes which remain healthy during an upgrade. During an upgrade, Marathon ensures that this number of healthy instances are up. The default is `1.0`, which means no old instance can be stopped before another healthy new version is deployed. A value of `0.5` means that during an upgrade half of the old version instances are stopped first to make space for the new version. A value of `0` means take all instances down immediately and replace with the new application.
- **maximumOverCapacity** The maximum percentage (expressed as a decimal fraction between `0.0` and `1.0`) of new instances that can be launched at any point during an upgrade. The default value is `1`, which means that all old and new instances can exist during the upgrade process. A value of `0.1` means that during the upgrade process 10% more capacity than usual may be used for old and new instances. A value of `0.0` means that even during the upgrade process no more capacity may be used for the new instances than usual. Only when an old version is stopped, a new instance can be deployed.

If `"minimumHealthCapacity": 1` and `"maximumOverCapacity": 0`, at least one additional new instance is launched in the beginning of the upgrade process. When it is healthy, one of the old instances is stopped. After it is stopped, another new instance is started, and so on.

A combination of `"minimumHealthCapacity": 0.9` and `"maximumOverCapacity": 0` results in a rolling update, replacing 10% of the instances at a time, keeping at least 90% of the app online at any point of time during the upgrade.

A combination of `"minimumHealthCapacity": 1` and `"maximumOverCapacity": 0.1` results in a rolling update, replacing 10% of the instances at a time and keeping at least 100% of the app online at any point of time during the upgrade with 10% of additional capacity.
