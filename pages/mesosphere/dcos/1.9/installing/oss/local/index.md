DC/OS Vagrant uses Vagrant and VirtualBox to create a cluster of virtual machines on your local machine that can be used for demos, development, and testing with DC/OS.

Quick Start and full documentation are maintained in the dcos-vagrant GitHub repository.

- For the latest bug fixes, use the [master branch](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant/).
- For increased stability, use the [latest official release](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant/releases/latest/).
- For older releases on DC/OS, you may need to download an [older release of DC/OS Vagrant](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant/releases/).

Feel free to try the master branch first. It's relatively stable and easiest to update (`git pull`). Then try the official releases if the master branch doesn't work for you.
