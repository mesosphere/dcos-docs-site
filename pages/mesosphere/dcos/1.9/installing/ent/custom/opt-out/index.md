## Telemetry

You can opt-out of providing anonymous data by disabling [telemetry][4] for your cluster. To disable telemetry, add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`][1] file during installation (note this requires using the [CLI][2] or [advanced][3] installers):

`telemetry_enabled: 'false'`

If youâ€™ve already installed your cluster and want to disable this in-place, you can go through an upgrade with the same parameter set.
