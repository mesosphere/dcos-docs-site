This section guides you through the basic steps to prepare your environment and install Konvoy on AWS.

## Prerequisites

* The [aws][install_aws] command line utility
* [Docker Desktop][install_docker] _version 18.09.2 or newer_
* [kubectl][install_kubectl] _v1.15.3 or newer_ (for interacting with the running cluster)
* A valid AWS account with [credentials configured][aws_credentials].
  You need to be authorized to create the following resources in the AWS account:
  * EC2 Instances
  * VPC
  * Subnets
  * Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
  * Internet Gateway
  * NAT Gateway
  * Elastic Block Storage (EBS) Volumes
  * Security Groups
  * Route Tables
  * IAM Roles

## Installation

After verifying your prerequisites, you can create an AWS Kubernetes cluster by running `konvoy up`.
This command creates your [Amazon EC2][ec2] instances, installs Kubernetes, and installs default add-ons to support your Kubernetes cluster.

Specifically, the `konvoy up` command does the following:

* Provisions three `t3.large` EC2 instances as Kubernetes master nodes
* Provisions four `t3.xlarge` EC2 instances as Kubernetes worker nodes
* Deploys all of the following default add-ons:
  * Calico
  * CoreDNS
  * Helm
  * AWS EBS CSI driver
  * Elasticsearch (including Elasticsearch Exporter)
  * Fluent Bit
  * Kibana
  * Prometheus operator (including Grafana, AlertManager and Prometheus Adapter)
  * Traefik
  * Kubernetes dashboard
  * Operations portal
  * Velero
  * Dex identity service
  * Dex Kubernetes client authenticator
  * Traefik forward authorization proxy
  * Kommander

The default configuration options are recommended for a small cluster (about 10 worker nodes).

## Modifying the cluster name

By default, the cluster name is the name of the folder where your run the `konvoy` command.
The cluster name will be used to tag the provisioned infrastructure and the context when applying the kubeconfig file.
To customize the cluster name, run the following command:

```bash
konvoy up --cluster-name <YOUR_SPECIFIED_NAME>
```

## Control plane and worker nodes

Control plane nodes are the nodes where the Kubernetes Control Plane components will be installed.
The Control Plane contains [various components][control_plane], including `etcd`, `kube-apiserver` (that [you will interact with through `kubectl`][kubectl]), `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager`. Please also refer to the [Concepts section][concepts].
Having three control plane nodes makes the cluster "highly available" to protect against failures.
Worker nodes run your containers in [Kubernetes pods][pods].

## Default addons

The default addons help you manage your Kubernetes cluster by providing monitoring (Prometheus), logging (Elasticsearch), dashboards (Kubernetes Dashboard), storage (AWS CSI Driver), ingress (Traefik) and other services.

## Viewing installation operations

As noted above, you start the cluster installation by running the `konvoy up` command.
As the `konvoy up` command runs, you will see output about the operations performed.
The first set of messages you see is the output generated by [Terraform][terraform] as it provisions your nodes.

After the nodes are provisioned, [Ansible][ansible] connects to the EC2 instances and installs Kubernetes in steps called tasks and playbooks.
Near the end of the output, addons are installed.

## Viewing cluster operations

You can access user interfaces to monitor your cluster through the [Operations Portal][ops_portal].
After you run the `konvoy up` command, if the installation is successful, the command output displays the information you need to access the Operations Portal.

For example, you should see information similar to this:

```text
Kubernetes cluster and addons deployed successfully!

Run `konvoy apply kubeconfig` to update kubectl credentials.

Navigate to the URL below to access various services running in the cluster.
  https://lb_addr-12345.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/ops/landing
And login using the credentials below.
  Username: AUTO_GENERATED_USERNAME
  Password: SOME_AUTO_GENERATED_PASSWORD_12345

The dashboard and services may take a few minutes to be accessible.
```

## Checking the files installed

When the `konvoy up` completes its setup operations, the following files are generated:

* `cluster.yaml` - defines the Konvoy configuration for the cluster, where you customize [your cluster provisioning configuration][cluster_provision] and [your addons][addons_config].
* `admin.conf` - is a [kubeconfig file][kubeconfig], which contains credentials to [connect to the `kube-apiserver` of your cluster through `kubectl`][kubectl].
* `inventory.yaml` - is an [Ansible Inventory file][inventory].
* `state` folder - contains Terraform files, including a [state file][state].
* `cluster-name-ssh.pem`/`cluster-name-ssh.pub` - stores the SSH keys used to connect to the EC2 instances.
* `runs` folder - which contains logging information.
