The topics in this section describe advanced provisioning and configuration options for deploying Konvoy on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

# Customize region and availability zones

Konvoy supports provisioning hosts across multiple zones in a GCP region.
For instance, the following configuration instructs Konvoy to provision hosts across the three zones in `us-west1` region.

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: konvoy
spec:
  provider: gcp
  gcp:
    region: us-west1
    zones:
    - us-west1-a
    - us-west1-b
    - us-west1-c
```

# Customize instance types, volumes and OS Image

In Konvoy users can customize instance types, volumes and OS images for their clusters like the following:

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: konvoy
spec:
  provider: gcp
  gcp:
    region: us-west1
    zones:
    - us-west1-a
    - us-west1-b
    - us-west1-c
  nodePools:
  - name: worker
    count: 8
    machine:
      rootVolumeSize: 80
      rootVolumeType: pd-ssd
      imagefsVolumeEnabled: true
      imagefsVolumeSize: 160
      imagefsVolumeType: pd-ssd
      type: n1-standard-8
      imageID: rhel-7
  - name: control-plane
    controlPlane: true
    count: 3
    machine:
      rootVolumeSize: 80
      rootVolumeType: pd-ssd
      imagefsVolumeEnabled: true
      imagefsVolumeSize: 160
      imagefsVolumeType: pd-ssd
      type: n1-standard-4
      imageID: rhel-7
```

## Instance types

For each [node pool][node_pools], users can customize the instance type for instances, in that node pool, using the `type` field.

All available virtual machine types can be found [here][virtual_machine_types].

## Instance volumes

For each [node pool][node_pools], users can customize the instance volumes attached to the instances in that node pool.
There are two types of instance volumes:

* Root volume: This is the root disk for providing [ephemeral storage][ephemeral_storage] for the Kubernetes node (except container images if imagefs volume is enabled).
* Imagefs volume: This is the dedicated disk for providing storage for container image layers.

Imagefs volume is optional.
If disabled, the root volume is used to store container image layers.

Users can customize the sizes (in GB) and [types][disks] of those volumes.

## GCP VM Images

In GCP, you can define already available [public images][public_images] as `imageID` or your own images from an available image self link.

The default GCP Image used for Konvoy cluster deployments is the latest available `centos-7`

Konvoy is tested with the `CentOS Linux 7` image.

# Adding custom Terraform resources for provisioning

You can provide custom `*.tf` resource files when provisioning.
If you create additional resource files, they are used with the default `*.tf` resource files during the provisioning process.

To add custom resource files for provisioning:

1. Create a new directory named `extras/provisioner/` to contain your custom resource files.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p extras/provisioner
    ```

1. Create a file in the `extras/provisioner/` directory to include your custom backend settings.

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF > extras/provisioner/backend.tf
    terraform {
      backend "gcs" {
        bucket  = "konvoy"
        prefix  = "${local.cluster_name}-terraform/state"
      }
    }
    EOF
    ```

    <p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Konvoy merges any files you add to the <code>extras/provisioner</code> directory with the default <code>*.tf</code> resource files during the provisioning process. If you add a file name to the <code>extras/provisioner</code> directory that already exists in the default <code>*.tf</code> resource files, the contents of the default <code>*.tf</code> resource file are replaced with the contents from the custom file you added to the <code>extras/provisioner</code> directory.</p>

1. Run the `konvoy up` command.

    As the command runs, the Terraform program merges the resource files and produces output similar to the following:

    ```text
    Successfully configured the backend "gcs"! Terraform will automatically
    use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
    ```

    The output, in this example, indicates that Terraform has successfully merged content from the `backend.tf` resource file and will store the state file in Goocle Cloud Storage.

## Network
You can also use an existing network.
To do so you must modify the `cluster.yaml` file and change the `ProvisionerConfig` in the following way:

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: konvoy
spec:
  provider: gcp
  gcp:
    region: us-west1
    zones:
    - us-west1-a
    - us-west1-b
    - us-west1-c
    network:
      selfLink: projects/my-project-id/global/networks/my-predefined-network
...
```

### Internal only kube-apiserver LB / Forwarding rule

It is **not** possible to set the kube-apiserver LB to be `internal`.
The GCP forwarding rules do not allow a request, from a backend member, to be directed to another backend member internally.
This behaviour is documented [here][forwading_rules_internal].

### Subnets
An existing network may already contain `subnets` for use. You can define them in the following way:

```yaml
...
spec:
  provider: gcp
  gcp:
    region: us-west1
    zones:
    - us-west1-a
    - us-west1-b
    - us-west1-c
    network:
      selfLink: projects/my-project-id/global/networks/my-predefined-network
  nodePools:
  - name: worker
    count: 8
    machine:
      rootVolumeSize: 80
      rootVolumeType: pd-ssd
      imagefsVolumeEnabled: true
      imagefsVolumeSize: 160
      imagefsVolumeType: pd-ssd
      type: n1-standard-8
      gcp:
        subnetIDs:
        - existing-subnet-for-konvoy
  - name: control-plane
    controlPlane: true
    count: 3
    machine:
      rootVolumeSize: 80
      rootVolumeType: pd-ssd
      imagefsVolumeEnabled: true
      imagefsVolumeSize: 160
      imagefsVolumeType: pd-ssd
      type: n1-standard-4
      gcp:
        subnetIDs:
        - existing-subnet-for-control-plane-konvoy
  - name: bastion
    bastion: true
    count: 1
    machine:
      rootVolumeSize: 80
      rootVolumeType: pd-ssd
      imagefsVolumeEnabled: true
      imagefsVolumeSize: 160
      imagefsVolumeType: pd-ssd
      type: n1-standard-4
      gcp:
        subnetIDs:
        - other-subnet
...
```

If no subnets are defined, Konvoy attempts to create subnets to cover missing nodepools.
This can lead to collisions in CIDR blocks and deploy failures. In this case we recommend a full list of subnets be known along with the nodepools needed.

For the most part, the nodepools created should exist in a private network configuration. This is Konvoy's default approach.
Bastion hosts allow for secure access to your cluster. Since they need to be accessed externally, they should be deployed with a subnet where public IPs are created.

The default Subnet CIDR blocks that are created by Konvoy are as follows:

* Public Subnet: `10.0.64.0/18`
* Private Subnet: `10.0.128.0/18`
* ControlPlane Subnet: `10.0.192.0/18`

Like the network, you can choose to use these blocks or define other appropriate blocks.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Keep in mind that the default value of <tt>spec.kubernetes.networking.serviceSubnet</tt> is set to <tt>10.0.0.0/18</tt>. The blocks you choose must not overlap with the <tt>serviceSubnet</tt>.</p>

### IAM Service Account and project role
An existing IAM Service Account and project role can be used, provided that the right policies are set:

```yaml
...
spec:
  provider: gcp
  nodePools:
  - name: worker
    count: 1
    machine:
      gcp:
        iam:
          serviceAccount:
            name: "service-account-name@GCPPROJECTNAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
            role: "project-role-name-to-be-used"
...
```
