For [on-premise install][install_onprem], there are a few SSH related options that users can customize in the [Ansible][ansible] [inventory file][ansible_inventory].

## `wait_for_connection`

This specifies the way that Ansible uses to check the connectivity to a node.

* `socket`: Use [`wait_for`][ansible_wait_for] to check socket level connectivity (default).
* `ssh`: Use [`wait_for_connection`][ansible_wait_for_connection] to check connectivity using SSH.

Note that `ssh` mode requires Python to be pre-installed on the target host.
But could be useful when SSH proxy is used.

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    version: "v1beta1"
    order: sorted
    wait_for_connection: ssh
```

## `ssh_common_args`

If specified, the extra arguments will be appended to all SSH related operations.
This is useful when SSH proxy is used.

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    version: "v1beta1"
    order: sorted
    wait_for_connection: ssh
    ssh_common_args: "-o ProxyCommand=\"ssh -p 3023 %r@localhost -s proxy:%h:%p\""
```

## Create a Konvoy cluster with preexisting ssh keys

You can create a Konvoy cluster with preexisting ssh keys using one of the following methods:

- Copy both the private and public key into the working directory and name them `<CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pem` and `<CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pub`, respectively.

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta2
spec:
  sshCredentials:
    user: centos
    publicKeyFile: <CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pub
    privateKeyFile: <CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pem
```

**NOTE**: `<CLUSTER_NAME>` represents the cluster name defined in the `cluster.yaml` file, as shown in the following:

```yaml
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta2
metadata:
  name: myClusterName
spec:
```

- If the keys are in your `~/.ssh/` directory, specify the file location. Because Konvoy runs as a container, not all directories are available in the container, but the `$HOME` directory is always mounted.

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta2
spec:
  sshCredentials:
    user: centos
    publicKeyFile: ~/.ssh/<CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pub
    privateKeyFile: ~/.ssh/<CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pem
```

- If the key is in your `ssh-agent`, specify only the public key. Your public key is copied to the nodes by Terraform, and the `ssh-agent` is used when connecting to those nodes.

```yaml
kind: ClusterProvisioner
apiVersion: konvoy.mesosphere.io/v1beta2
spec:
  sshCredentials:
    user: centos
    publicKeyFile: ~/.ssh/<CLUSTER_NAME>-ssh.pub
```
