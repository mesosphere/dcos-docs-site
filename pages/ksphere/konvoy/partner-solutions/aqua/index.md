Aqua tames the complexity of securing Kubernetes deployments with policy-driven controls that leverage native K8s capabilities, while adding deeper image assurance, runtime protection, and network security controls.

## quick start

### prerequisites

Before you can get started you will need to [contact Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com/about-us/contact-us/) to obtain the following.

* Aqua `username` and `password`
* Aqua CSP `license token`

With the username and password you will be able to sign into [https://my.aquasec.com](https://my.aquasec.com). Navigate to `Licenses` section where you will find the CSP `license token`.

**Note:** All product specific `documentation links` in the following can only be reached if you are signed into [https://my.aquasec.com](https://my.aquasec.com).

Next we create the `aqua` namespace.

```sh
kubectl create namespace aqua
```

After that we create the `csp-registry-secret` with the `username` and `passsword` we got before. The secret is required to pull the Aqua container images from the private Aqua docker registry.

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry csp-registry-secret  --docker-server="registry.aquasec.com" --namespace aqua --docker-username="jg@example.com" --docker-password="Truckin" --docker-email="jg@example.com"
```

Clone the `aqua-helm` github repository to get access to the helm charts.

**Note:** We clone a specific 'Aqua version 4.2'. The quick start is specific to that version.

```sh
git clone -b 4.2 https://github.com/aquasecurity/aqua-helm.git

cd aqua-helm
```

#### temporary workaround to install the Aqua container images

**Note:** Konvoy is using `containerd`. There is currently an issue with the Aqua container registry when pulling private images. Thats why we need the additional steps described in this section until the issue gets resolved.

**Note:** In your Konvoy `cluster.yaml file` remove the line `-  AlwaysPullImages` before creating the cluster with `konvoy up`.
```yaml
...
spec:
  kubernetes:
    admissionPlugins:
      enabled:
      - NodeRestriction
      - AlwaysPullImages
      disabled: []
...
```

Use your `Aqua credentials` to login to the `Aqua container registry`.

```sh
docker login registry.aquasec.com
```

Next execute the following script. It pulls the Aqua container images, saves them in a tarball, copies the tarball to every worker node, and imports it into containerd.

**Note:** The script requires the aws cli and jq commands to be installed. On Mac OS X both can be installed using brew. You also have to login to your aws account using the aws cli.

```sh
CLUSTER=... # name of your cluster, its the prefix used for worker nodes, check in ec2 console
REGION=us-west-2
KEY_FILE=... # path to private key file in folder where you ran konvoy -up


docker pull registry.aquasec.com/database:4.2
docker pull registry.aquasec.com/gateway:4.2
docker pull registry.aquasec.com/console:4.2
docker pull registry.aquasec.com/scanner:4.2
docker pull registry.aquasec.com/enforcer:4.2

docker save registry.aquasec.com/scanner:4.2 registry.aquasec.com/console:4.2 registry.aquasec.com/gateway:4.2 registry.aquasec.com/database:4.2 registry.aquasec.com/enforcer:4.2 > aqua.tar.gz

IPS=$(aws --region=$REGION ec2 describe-instances |  jq --raw-output ".Reservations[].Instances[] | select((.Tags | length) > 0) | select(.Tags[].Value | test(\"$CLUSTER-worker\")) | select(.State.Name | test(\"running\")) | [.PublicIpAddress] | join(\" \")")

for ip in $IPS; do
  echo $ip;
  scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $KEY_FILE aqua.tar.gz centos@$ip:/tmp;
  ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i $KEY_FILE centos@$ip sudo ctr -n k8s.io image import /tmp/aqua.tar.gz;
done
```

### install the Aqua server, database, and gateway

Let install the Aqua `server`, `database`, and `gateway`.

```sh
helm upgrade --install --namespace aqua csp ./server --set scanner.enabled=true,imageCredentials.username=<>,imageCredentials.password=<>
```

Next enable localhost access to Aqua.

```sh
kubectl port-forward service/csp-console-svc 8080:8080 -n aqua
```

Click to open the [Aqua CSP console](http://localhost:8080).

When you access the `Aqua CSP console` for the first time, you must enter and confirm the `password` for the `administrator username`. After the login a screen appears where you have to enter the Aqua CSP License Token. After that you have access to the `Aqua dashboard`.

### install the Aqua enforcer

In the `Aqua CSP console` navigate to the `Enforcers` section to create an [Enforcer Group](https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/enforcer-group-settings). Note that the Orchestrator must be set to Kubernetes. Copy the `enforcer token`, we will need it in the next step.

Lets install the enforcer.

```sh
helm upgrade --install --namespace aqua csp-enforcer ./enforcer --set enforcerToken=<aquasec-token>
```

### delete Aqua

Delete the `CSP enforcer` and `CSP`.

```sh
helm delete --purge csp-enforcer
helm delete --purge csp
```
