[Gatekeeper][gatekeeper] is the policy controller for Kubernetes, allowing organizations to enforce configurable policies using the [Open Policy Agent][opa], a policy engine for Cloud Native environments hosted by CNCF as an incubation-level project.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Gatekeeper to enforce policies by rejecting non-compliant resources. Specifically, this tutorial will demonstrate two constraints as a way to show how to use Gatekeeper as an alternative to [Pod Security Policies][psp]:

- [Prevent the running of privileged pods](#prevent-privileged-pods)
- [Prevent mounting host path volumes](#prevent-host-path-volumes)

## Before you begin
Before starting this tutorial, you should verify the following:

- You must have access to a Linux, macOS, or Windows computer with a supported operating system version.

- You must have a properly deployed and running cluster. For information about deploying Kubernetes with default settings, see the [Quick start][quickstart].

## Deploy Gatekeeper

### (Optional) Deploy Cert Manager using Helm

Deploying [Cert Manager][certmanager] simplifies certificate generation in a Kubernetes cluster. While this tutorial will work without Cert Manager, it also integrates seamlessly with Cert Manager.

Follow the [installation documentation][certmanager-install] to deploy Cert Manager using Helm.

### (Optional) Deploy Gatekeeper using Helm

You might have already installed Gatekeeper as a Konvoy addon on your cluster. If that is the case, you can directly start using it.

1. Ensure that Gatekeeper is not already installed by checking the Helm releases running on your cluster:

    ```bash
    helm list
    ```

    Look for a release named `gatekeeper` or `gatekeeper-kubeaddons`. If there is one, you do not need to redeploy Gatekeeper.

1. Ensure you have added the Mesosphere Staging Helm chart repo with the following command:

    ```bash
    helm repo add mesosphere-staging https://mesosphere.github.io/charts/staging
    ```

1. Install Gatekeeper using Helm by running the following command:

    ```bash
    helm install mesosphere-staging/gatekeeper --name gatekeeper
    ```

    Alternatively, if you want to integrate with Cert Manager and have [installed Cert Manager](#optional-deploy-cert-manager-using-helm), use the following command:

    ```bash
    helm install mesosphere-staging/gatekeeper --name gatekeeper --set webhook.certManager.enabled=true
    ```

## Use Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper uses the [OPA Constraint Framework][opa-constraints] to describe and enforce policy. Before you can define a constraint, you must first define a `ConstraintTemplate`, which describes both the [`Rego`][opa-rego] (a powerful query language) that enforces the constraint and the schema of the constraint. The schema of the constraint allows an admin to fine-tune the behavior of a constraint, much like arguments to a function.

The Gatekeeper repository includes a [library of policies][gatekeeper-psp] to replace Pod Security Policies which we will use in the following tutorials.

### Prevent privileged pods

#### Define the ConstraintTemplate

Create the privileged pod policy constraint template `k8spspprivilegedcontainer` by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/library/pod-security-policy/privileged-containers/template.yaml
```

#### Define the Constraint

Constraints are then used to inform Gatekeeper that the admin wants a ConstraintTemplate to be enforced, and how.

Create the privileged pod policy constraint `psp-privileged-container` by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/library/pod-security-policy/privileged-containers/constraint.yaml
```

#### Test that the constraint is enforced

Try to create a privileged pod by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/library/pod-security-policy/privileged-containers/example.yaml
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Error from server ([denied by psp-privileged-container] Privileged container is not allowed: nginx, securityContext: {"privileged": true}): error when creating "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/library/pod-security-policy/privileged-containers/example.yaml": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [denied by psp-privileged-container] Privileged container is not allowed: nginx, securityContext: {"privileged": true}
```

### Prevent host path volumes

#### Define the ConstraintTemplate

Create the host path volume policy constraint template `k8spsphostfilesystem` by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/library/pod-security-policy/host-filesystem/template.yaml
```

#### Define the Constraint

Constraints are then used to inform Gatekeeper that the admin wants a ConstraintTemplate to be enforced, and how.

Create the host path volume policy constraint `psp-host-filesystem` by running the following command to only allow `/foo` to be mounted as a host path volume:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPHostFilesystem
metadata:
  name: psp-host-filesystem
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedHostPaths:
    - readOnly: true
      pathPrefix: "/foo"
EOF
```

#### Test that the constraint is enforced

Try to create a pod that mounts a disallowed host path by running the following command:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-host-filesystem
  labels:
    app: nginx-host-filesystem
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /tmp # directory location on host
EOF
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Error from server ([denied by psp-host-filesystem] HostPath volume {"hostPath": {"path": "/tmp", "type": ""}, "name": "cache-volume"} is not allowed, pod: nginx-host-filesystem. Allowed path: [{"readOnly": true, "pathPrefix": "/foo"}]): error when creating "STDIN": admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [denied by psp-host-filesystem] HostPath volume {"hostPath": {"path": "/tmp", "type": ""}, "name": "cache-volume"} is not allowed, pod: nginx-host-filesystem. Allowed path: [{"readOnly": true, "pathPrefix": "/foo"}]
```

#### Test that the constraint allows allowed host paths

Try to create a pod that mounts an allowed host path by running the following command:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-host-filesystem
  labels:
    app: nginx-host-filesystem
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /foo # directory location on host
EOF
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
pod/nginx-host-filesystem created
```
