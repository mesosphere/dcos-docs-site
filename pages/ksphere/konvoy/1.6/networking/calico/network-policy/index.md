# Network Policy

A network policy specifies how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with
each other and with other network endpoints.

In Konvoy, network policies are implemented by Calico.

Calico supports a wide range of [network policies][calico_policy].
It is tightly integrated with Kubernetes network policy.
You can use `kubectl` to configure Kubernetes network policy which would be enforced by Calico.
Further, Calico extends Kubernetes network policy through custom CRDs which can be configured using [calicoctl][calicoctl].
