### Mayadata OpenEBS

MayaData offers software to accelerate the building and operations of stateful applications on Kubernetes based clouds, whether on-premises, on public or hybrid clouds. Mayadata leverages the open source OpenEBS and other open source components.

OpenEBS is the leading open-source project for container-attached and container-native storage on Kubernetes. OpenEBS adopts a Container Attached Storage (CAS) approach, where each workload is provided with a dedicated storage controller. OpenEBS implements granular storage policies and isolation that enables users to optimize storage for each specific workload.

OpenEBS runs in user space and does not have any Linux kernel module dependencies.
