By default, the client access token lifetime is 24 hours. After this time, the token expires and cannot be used to authenticate. Follow these steps to change the lifetime:

1.  Find the `dex` addon in cluster.yaml, and set its `values` field:

    ```yaml
    - name: dex
        enabled: true
        values: |
        config:
          expiry:
          idTokens: "48h"
    ```

2.  Run `konvoy deploy addons`, or `konvoy up` if you have yet to deploy the cluster.
