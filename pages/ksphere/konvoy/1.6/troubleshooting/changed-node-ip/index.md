## Cloud Providers

Konvoy uses public IPs to communicate with the nodes. Konvoy sets `ansible_host` in `inventory.yaml`, to a DNS name. Cloud providers DNS names on the node's public IP. When you restart a node, it will get a new public IP assigned to it. To refresh the IP information in the `inventory.yaml` you need to run `konvoy up` or `konvoy provision`.

## On-Premises

In on-premises deployments you will need to update the `inventory.yaml` manually. Please refer to the [on-premises documentation][on-premises].
