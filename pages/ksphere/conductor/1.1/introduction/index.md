D2iQâ€™s Conductor is a distributed learning platform that enables you to train your team using interactive cloud-native content - using a mix of traditional documentation, video training, self-guided labs, quizzes and tests - all served in a web-based single-page integrated learning environment.

# Conductor features and benefits
This is the first release of Conductor's self-hosted offering, featuring the following capabilities:
- **Easy on-prem/cloud installation**:
    Operators can now install Conductor on their own Kubernetes cluster using only a helm chart and a few common addons.

- **File Editor**:
    Learners can view, edit, and save files in their training environment workspaces from the easy-to-use *File Editor* GUI tab.

- **Sign-up Link Tool**:
    Administrators can now invite any number of learners to use Conductor by generating and then sharing a disposable sign-up link from the *Admin Portal* page.

# Known Issues

The following are known issues as of Conductor v1.0:

## Traefik Bug

There is a bug in Traefik v1.7.23 that causes Conductor v1.0 to break. Because Konvoy v1.4 depends on this version of Traefik, Conductor v1.0 is not currently compatible with Konvoy v1.4.

## Air Gapped Install
Air gapped installations are not supported in this release of Conductor.

## Backup and Restore
Backing up and restoring the Conductor environment is not supported in this release of Conductor.

# Browser Compatibility

Conductor only supports the following browsers:

| Browser | Tested | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome 81 |  Y | Works as expected.  |
| Firefox 76 | Y | Works as expected.  |
|  Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 81.0.416.77 |  Y |  Fails due to incompatible limitation with present strategy for passing credentials. |
| Safari 12 | Y | SSH can disconnect if browser left unattended too long. Max observed: 1-2 times per 2-3 hour session. Refreshing the browser is a workaround to reestablish ssh connectivity with the cluster. |
