### Better Support for Self-Hosted Application Errors
Now D2iQ Customer Operations Team can better support customer application issues for self-hosted deployments of Conductor by using application error bundles sent from the customer's deployment.

### Backup and Restore with Postgresql (PG)
Backing up and restoring Conductor's PG database is now enabled by downloading the utility package `conductor-tools` via the Support Portal.

### Production-like capability via Konvoy learning clusters on AWS
For teaching our more advanced Kuberntes use-cases, we use various cluster configurations using D2iQ's flagship Kubernetes distribution, Konvoy. Just configure by inputting your AWS credentials for the account where your Konvoy cluster is deployed, and any associated cloud spend can be tracked there.
