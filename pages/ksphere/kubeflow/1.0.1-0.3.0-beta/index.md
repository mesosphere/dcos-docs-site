D2iQ Kubeflow is a general cloud native, enterprise-grade, and end-to-end ML/AI platform. The product is a set of open
source products, including Kubeflow, with optimized configurations that supports end-to-end machine learning workflows.

D2iQ Kubeflow empowers Data Scientists and ML Engineers to run and scale their entire ML stack with much higher velocity on Kubernetes
infrastructure.

D2iQ Kubeflow natively integrates Horovod - an open source distributed training framework -
to support distributed deep learning across multi-GPU and multi-node clusters. Horovod is compatible with the existing
TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet deep learning frameworks and makes distributed Deep Learning super fast and easy.

D2iQ Kubeflow is also pre-configured with Apache Spark, providing the ability to tap into large pools of CPUs and
GPUs, on demand.
