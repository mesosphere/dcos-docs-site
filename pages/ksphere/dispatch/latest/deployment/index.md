# Deploying Applications with GitOps

Dispatch enables software and applications to be continuously deployed (CD) using GitOps processes. GitOps enables the application to be deployed as per a manifest that is stored in a git repo.  This ensures that the application deployment can be automated, audited and declaratively deployed to the infrastructure.

This tutorial assumes that you have followed the [Dispatch Installation](../install/) and [Setting up a repository to use Dispatch](../repo-setup/) tutorials and have set up Dispatch CI for a hello-world application.

## Quick Start

This section provides a dense set of instructions for deploying a hello-world
application to your kubernetes cluster using Dispatch. The subsequent sections
provide background and go into greater details regarding the individual steps.

*NOTE: Replace `your-user` with your GitHub username in all the following steps.*

- Fork https://github.com/mesosphere/cicd-hello-world-gitops to your own account.
- Run `dispatch login github --secret gitops-secret-1 --user $YOURGITHUBUSERNAME --token $YOURGITHUBTOKEN`
- Run `dispatch gitops app create hello-world --repo=https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops --scm-secret gitops-secret-1`
- Add the GitOps repository as a resource to your hello-world application's Dispatchfile:
  ```
  resource "gitops-git": {
    type: "git"
    param url: "https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops"
  }
  ```
- Add a `deploy` task to your hello-world application's Dispatchfile:
  ```
  task "deploy": {
    inputs: ["docker-image", "gitops-git"]
    steps: [
      {
        name: "update-gitops-repo"
        image: "mesosphere/update-gitops-repo:v1.0"
        workingDir: "/workspace/gitops-git"
        args: [
          "-git-revision=$(context.git.commit)",
          "-substitute=imageName=your-user/hello-world@$(inputs.resources.docker-image.digest)"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Add the `deploy` task as an action to be taken when the `master` branch is modifed:
  ```
  actions: [
    {
      tasks: ["build", "deploy"]
      on push branches: ["master"]
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```
- Commit this change to a feature branch, push the branch, create a pull request
  and merge it into `master` of your hello-world application's git repository.
- Once merged, a `master` build is triggered. Open your browser to
  `/dispatch/tekton/`, hit the PipelineRuns tab, and notice that a new `master`
  build is running.
- Once it completes, it will create a new pull request against the GitOps
  repository. Open the pull request from https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops/pulls
- Merge the pull request to `master`.
- Open the Argo CD UI at `/dispatch/argo-cd`, click on the hello-world application.
- You can now hit Refresh in the action bar at the top of the page or wait 180s
  for Argo CD to automatically pick up the change to the GitOps repository and
  deploy those changes to the cluster.

Now that you've configured CI to build your application and CD to deploy it, an
example of the day-to-day workflow is:

- Modify the `main.go` file in your hello-world application's git repo. Edit the
  message in the last `fmt.Fprintf` at the very bottom of the file.
- Commit the change to a feature branch, push it, and create a pull request.
- Once your pull request passes CI and has the necessary number of approvals,
  merge it to `master`.
- This triggers another round of CI, which you can watch on the PipelineRuns
  page of the Tekton dashboard hosted at `/dispatch/tekton/`.
- As the final step of that CI run, a new pull request is opened against the
  GitOps repository at https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops
- Review and merge that pull request.
- Wait 180s or navigate to the Argo CD UI at `/dispatch/argo-cd`, click the
  hello-world application, and hit Refresh. This triggers deployment of the
  latest docker image.
- Open the `/hello-world` URL relative to your cluster URL and notice that the
  page now shows your updated message.

The following sections go into more detail.

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern software deployment strategy. The configuration describing
how your application is deployed to a cluster are stored in a git repository.
The configuration is continuously synchronized from this git repository to the
cluster, ensuring that the specified state of the cluster always matches what is
defined in the "GitOps" git repository.

The benefits of following a GitOps deployment strategy are:

- *Familiar, collaborative change and review process*. Engineers are intimately
  familiar with git-based workflows: branches, pull requests, code reviews, etc.
  GitOps leverages this experience to gate deployment of software and updates
  to catch issues early.
- *Clear change log and audit trail*. The git commit log serves as an audit
  trail to answer the question: "_Who_ changed _what_, _when_?" Having such
  information readily available allows you to reach out to the right people when
  fixing or triaging a production incident to determine the _why_ and correctly
  resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Additionally, Dispatch's CD component
  (Argo CD) maintains a separate audit trail in the form of Kubernetes Events,
  as changes to a git repository don't include exactly when those changes were
  deployed.
- *Avoid configuration drift*. The scope of manual changes made by operators
  expands over time. It soon becomes difficult to know which cluster
  configuration is critical and which is left over from temporary workarounds or
  live debugging. Over time, changing project configuration or replicating a
  deployment to a new environment becomes a daunting task. GitOps supports
  simple, reproducible deployment to multiple different clusters by having a
  single source of truth for cluster and application configuration.

That said, there are some cases when live debugging is necessary in order to
resolve an incident in the minimum amount of time. In such cases, a pull
request-based workflow adds expensive overhead when you need it least. Dispatch's
CD strategy supports this scenario by letting you disable the Auto Sync feature.
Once Auto Sync is disabled, Dispatch will stop synchronizing the cluster state
from the GitOps git repository. This let's you reach for _kubectl_, _helm_ or
whichever tool you need to resolve the issue.

Once you're done, Dispatch will show that your cluster configuration has diverged
from your GitOps repository. The diff can be viewed in the UI and the changes
carefully transferred back to the GitOps repository. Once the diff between the
cluster and the GitOps repository drops to zero, you can safely re-enable Auto
Sync.

Dispatch leverages the [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) Open Source
project to manage Continuous Delivery of your software. It is installed as part
of Dispatch.

## Setup GitOps repository

First, we need to create a git repository for GitOps. Going forward, we omit
"git" and refer to this repository as the "GitOps repository".

1. Log in to https://github.com
1. Visit https://github.com/mesosphere/cicd-hello-world-gitops and fork the
   repository to your own GitHub account. For this tutorial, we assume that the
   GitOps repository is _public_. Dispatch will deploy the kubernetes manifests
   defined in this GitOps repository to your cluster.
1. Assuming your GitHub user or organization is `your-user`, you now have a GitOps
   repository at `https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops`.

The GitOps repository at `https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops` now
contains the Kubernetes manifests describing how to deploy the hello-world
application on your cluster. We assume that the GitHub credentials used when you
configured Dispatch grant write access to this new repository, since we will be
updating the GitOps repository as the final step of the hello-world
application's CI, as defined in its Dispatchfile.

The hello-world application sources can be found at
https://github.com/mesosphere/cicd-hello-world and were used in the [Dispatch
Installation](../install/), [Setting up a repository to use
Dispatch](../repo-setup/), and [Pipeline Configuration
Reference](../pipeline-configuration/) examples elsewhere in the Dispatch
documentation. If you have followed the [Dispatch Installation](../install/) and
[Setting up a repository to use Dispatch](../repo-setup/) tutorials, your local
`cicd-hello-world` git repository will be up-to-date and ready to follow along.
For this tutorial, we focus on the Continuous Deployment part of CI/CD.

For this tutorial, the GitOps repository is public. If it was a private
repository, you would need to create a new GitHub Personal Access Token that
grants READ access to the GitOps repository. You would then add that access
token using the following command:

```sh
dispatch gitops creds add https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops --username your-user --token $GITOPSTOKEN
```

Next, we need to add our GitOps repository to Dispatch so that it knows
to keep our cluster in sync with the Kubernetes manifests in the repository.

If you already have a service account, say `team-1`, that is configured with a
GitHub Personal Access Token that you want to use to administer webhooks on the
GitOps repository, you can reuse it as follows:

```sh
dispatch gitops app create hello-world --repo=https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops --service-account team-1
```

If you want to register new credentials with Dispatch to manage webhooks on the
GitOps repository, you can do so as follows:

```sh
dispatch login github --secret gitops-secret-1 --user $YOURGITHUBUSERNAME --token $YOURGITHUBTOKEN
dispatch gitops app create hello-world --repo=https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops --scm-secret gitops-secret-1
```

You can now open your browser and navigate to the Argo CD UI. The Argo CD UI is
available at the `/dispatch/argo-cd` URL relative to your Kubernetes cluster's URL.

You can see that the hello-world application has been created. If you click on
the hello-world application you can see a visualization of the various
Kubernetes resources related to the hello-world application: Ingress, Service,
Deployment, ReplicaSet, and Pod. You can further click on any of the resources
to view more information. You can see the Kubernetes manifest for each resource
and, in the case of the hello-world Pod, you can also view the logs in real-time.

The hello-world application itself is reachable at the `/hello-world` URL
relative to your cluster URL.

## Automating image tag updates

Looking at the GitOps repository sources, we see two files:

- _application.yaml.tmpl_ contains all the Kubernetes manifests that define how
  the hello-world application should be deployed and configured on the cluster.
  It contains a special `$({ .imageName })` string which is replaced with the
  image name and unique SHA256 digest of the Docker image to deploy.
- _application.yaml_ is generated from _application.yaml.tmpl_ during CI.

In Dispatch Alpha, the regenerate step is performed as part of the hello-world
application's CI and is defined in its Dispatchfile. For subsequent releases, the
CI and CD phases will not be coupled in this way: the application's Dispatchfile
should relate to CI, only, and not be tightly coupled to CD (so that one may
deploy the same application to multiple different clusters using different
GitOps repositories for each cluster.)

Instead of deploying raw Kubernetes manifests as in this example, the GitOps
repository may contains Helm charts, too. In that case, you will have a
`values.yaml` file specifying an image tag, and a `values.yaml.tmpl` where the
image tag is replaced with the `$({ .imageName })` placeholder string. During CI,
when the pull request is created against the GitOps repository, the
`values.yaml.tmpl` file will be evaluated and the `$({ .imageName })` placeholder
string will be replaced by the unique SHA256 digest of the new Docker image
generated as part of the hello-world application's CI, and the resulting file
contents will overwrite the `values.yaml` file.

The use of template files allows you to mark specific parts of your Kubernetes
configuration files (e.g., `values.yaml` or `application.yaml`) and have those
parts get dynamically replaced as part of a successful CI build, with the
changes turned into pull requests against your GitOps repository.

We now modify your application's Dispatchfile to open a pull request against the
GitOps repository and update the Docker image digest. We will execute this task
when commits are pushed to the `master` branch, or equivalently, when a PR is
merged into the `master` branch.

First, we define the GitOps repository as a "resource" in the Dispatchfile. Add
the following definition to the top of your Dispatchfile (replace `your-user`
with your GitHub username):

```
resource "gitops-git": {
  type: "git"
  param url: "https://github.com/your-user/cicd-hello-world-gitops"
}
```

Add the following task to your hello-world application's Dispatchfile (replace
'your-user' with your actual DockerHub username):

```
task "deploy": {
  inputs: ["docker-image", "gitops-git"]
  steps: [
    {
      name: "update-gitops-repo"
      image: "mesosphere/update-gitops-repo:v1.0"
      workingDir: "/workspace/gitops-git"
      args: [
        "-git-revision=$(context.git.commit)",
        "-substitute=imageName=your-user/hello-world@$(inputs.resources.docker-image.digest)"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Next, in the `actions` section of your Dispatchfile, add the `deploy` task to the
list of tasks to run when new commits are pushed to the `master` branch.

Change this:

```
actions: [
  {
    tasks: ["build"]
    on push branches: ["master"]
  },
  ...
]
```

To this:

```
actions: [
  {
    tasks: ["build", "deploy"]
    on push branches: ["master"]
  },
  ...
]
```

If you're unsure exactly what changes to make, you can have a look at the diff
here: https://github.com/mesosphere/cicd-hello-world/compare/step_3...step_4

Make this change on a feature branch of your hello-world application git
repository, not your hello-world-gitops repository.

Submit submit your change as a pull request to your own hello-world git
repository, and merge the pull request into the `master` branch. When the pull
request is merged to your `master` branch, Dispatch will perform the `build` and
`deploy` tasks. The `build` task will build a new docker image and push it to
DockerHub as `your-user/hello-world`. The `deploy` task will open a new pull
request against your GitOps repository to update the Docker image digest in the
_application.yaml_ with the Docker image name and exact docker image digest of
the new Docker image that was built as part of the `build` task.

Once you've merged the pull request to your hello-world application's git
repository, you can visit the `/dispatch/tekton/` URL relative to your cluster
URL, hit the "PipelineRuns" tab, and notice that a `master` branch build has
been triggered.

The final step of the PipelinRun is our new `deploy` task. Once it completes, it
will print the URL of the pull request against your GitOps repository. If you
have Slack integration enabled for your GitOps repository, you will see a
notification that a new pull request has been created.

## Deploying the application after GitOps repository is updated

Once you have reviewed the pull request against your GitOps repository, merge it
to the `master` branch.

At this point, the GitOps repository has been modified. We expect Argo CD to
pick up that there were changes (specifically, the Docker image digest has been
updated). Once it does, it will compare the configuration as defined in the
GitOps repository with the configuration running in the cluster and notice that
the cluster is Out Of Sync with the GitOps repository.

For Dispatch Alpha, the GitOps repository is automatically scanned for changes
every 180 seconds. You can trigger a manual refresh using the Argo CD UI at
`/pumkin/argo-cd` by clicking to the hello-world application and hitting Refresh
in the action bar at the top of the page.

For Dispatch Beta we will use webhooks to trigger a refresh whenever the GitOps
repository is updated.

You have now configured deployment of your hello-world application to your
cluster using GitOps. You can test the pipeline by modifying the message
displayed on the `/hello-world` page.

Open the `main.go` file in the hello-world git repository and change the last
`fmt.Fprintf` statement to print a message of your choice. Commit your change to
a new feature branch, create a pull request from your feature branch, and merge
it to `master`. Once the `master` CI build succeeds, you can see a new pull
request was get created against the GitOps repository. Merge it, then trigger an
Refresh in the Argo CD UI (or wait ~180s) to see Argo CD pick up the change and
deploy it.

Once deployed, you can visit the `/hello-world` URL relative to your cluster URL
to see the new message displayed.
