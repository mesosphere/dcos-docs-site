# Upgrading

If you are upgrading, make sure to set `minio.persistence.size=100Gi` or upgrades will fail. In your `cluster.yaml`:

```yaml
  - configRepository: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch
    configVersion: stable-1.16-1.0.0
    addonsList:
    - name: dispatch
      enabled: true
      values: |
        minio:
          persistence:
            size: 100Gi
```
Or via `dispatch init`:

```bash
dispatch init --set minio.persistence.size=100Gi
```

## Upgrading from 1.0.0-rcX

There is an issue with upgrading from 1.0.0-rcX to 1.0.0. Prior to upgrading, run:

```bash
kubectl delete jobs -n dispatch dispatch-set-argocd-auth-token
```
