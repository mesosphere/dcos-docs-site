excerpt: Using YAML, configure and set up a code repository for access by Dispatch, including configuring a Dispatchfile
---

This topic provides a step-by-step tutorial for setting up dispatch and getting your first successful cloud native CI build on your GitHub repository. It will leverage the YAML front end language.

# Prerequisites

1. Some basic knowledge of git, bash, and Docker.
1. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
1. Owner permissions for a project hosted on [GitHub](../../tutorials/ci_tutorials/credentials/index.md#setting-up-github-credentials) or access to create one.
1. Deploy access to a namespace in Kubernetes cluster.
1. Dispatch [CLI installed](../../install/cli/) in the environment.

# Setup a git repository

## Initialize a git repository

Begin by creating a [new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) and clone it locally. You may skip this if you intend to use an existing repository on GitHub. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, this repository is named `helloworld`.

For the purposes of this tutorial, focus on creating a CI check that uses a Docker image to test the source code. This tutorial assumes the Docker image is testing the `golang` source code present in the repository but this can be replaced with any other Docker image trivially.

Go to the directory where you've cloned the repository
```bash
cd helloworld
```

Add some golang source and test files
```bash
cat <<EOF | > main.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello %v!", World())
}

func World() string {
    return "World"
}
EOF
cat <<EOF | > main_test.go
package main

import (
    "testing"
)

func Test_World(t *testing.T) {
    actual := World()
    if actual != "World" {
        t.Fail()
    }
}
EOF
```

If you have `go` in the environment, you can verify that the above code works using `go test -v ./...`.

For the sake of this tutorial, we can add a simple `Dockerfile` that builds from the base `golang` image to run the tests. Create this dockerfile:

```bash
cat <<EOF | > Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.14.0

ADD main.go /test/main.go
ADD main_test.go /test/main_test.go
EOF
```

In the later sections, we will setup CI infrastructure to run the tests on every pull request. As a side note, real life test scripts are much more complicated (obviously!) such as launching a kind cluster and running some tests on the cluster. The focus of this tutorial is to demonstrate the ability to run a simple CI build and this should be extendable to more complicated tests.

# Install Dispatch

[Refer to this guide for install options](../../install/).

By default, Dispatch installs to `dispatch` namespace and can be overridden during install time. This tutorial assumes Dispatch is installed to `dispatch` namespace.

Rest of the tutorial assumes you are working with `default` namespace for pipelines. Add a `--namespace` flag to commands as applicable if you are  working with a different namespace.

# Setup credentials & Service accounts

[Refer to this guide on setting up credentials](../../tutorials/ci_tutorials/credentials).

For the purposes of this tutorial, you need at least Github & Docker credentials. At the bare minimum, you should have executed (with appropriate names):

1. Create a service account named team-1

    ```bash
    dispatch serviceaccount create team-1
    ```

1. Create a Docker credential

    ```bash
    dispatch login docker --service-account team-1
    ```

1. Create a github credential

    ```bash
    dispatch login github --service-account team-1 --user $YOURGITHUBUSERNAME --token $YOURGITHUBTOKEN
    ```

    <p class="message--note">NOTE: </strong>If your Kubernetes cluster endpoint presents a self-signed TLS certificates you must pass `--insecure-webhook-skip-tls-verify` to the `login github` command, otherwise GitHub will refuse to deliver webhook events to Dispatch.</p>


1. Create a git SSH credential __only__ if you want to be able to build locally

    ```bash
    dispatch login git --service-account team-1 --private-key-path $SSH_KEY_PATH
    ```

# Setup repository in Dispatch

[Refer to this guide for repo setup](../../tutorials/ci_tutorials/repo-setup/).

At the least, you should execute the following:

```bash
dispatch ci repository create --service-account=team-1
```

In the next section, we are going to define the build specification in a file named `Dispatchfile`

# Adding a Dispatchfile to git repository

In this tutorial, we are going to use [starlark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/language.html) and create a file named `Dispatchfile` which holds our build specification. This is a step-by-step walk-through of creating our `Dispatchfile`:

1. Declare the DSL (Domain Specific Language) syntax for our `Dispatchfile` using shebang:

    ```bash
    #!mesosphere/dispatch-yaml:v0.3
    ```

   This specifies to use version `0.3` of YAML DSL parser.

1.  Declare the git resource:

    ```yaml
    resource:
      helloworld-git:
        param:
          revision: $(context.git.commit)
          url: $(context.git.url)
        type: git
    ```

1. Declare a docker image resource to push the new image to:

    ```yaml
    resource:
      docker-image:
        param:
          digest: $(inputs.resources.docker-image.digest)
          url: docker.io/$YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
        type: image
    ```

1.  Declare a task to build and push the Docker image using [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko):

    ```yaml
    task:
      build:
        inputs:
        - helloworld-git
        outputs:
        - docker-image
        steps:
        - args:
          - --destination=$(outputs.resources.docker-image.url)
          - --context=/workspace/helloworld-git
          - --oci-layout-path=/workspace/output/docker-image
          - --dockerfile=/workspace/helloworld-git/Dockerfile
          image: chhsiao/kaniko-executor
          name: build-and-push
          resources: {}
    ```

1.  Declare a task using above Docker image to run tests:

    ```yaml
    task:
      unit-test-simple:
        inputs:
        - docker-image
        - helloworld-git
        steps:
        - command:
          - go
          - test
          - ./...
          image: $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
          name: unit-test-simple
          resources: {}
          workingDir: /workspace/helloworld-git/
    ```

    We listed the "helloworld-git" git resource as an input to the "unit-test-simple" task. That means that our git repository contents will be available at `/workspace/helloworld-git/`, so we set the `workingDir` to that directory.


1.  Define an _Action_ to run the task on every pull request:

    ```yaml
    actions:
    - "on":
        pull_request: {}
      tasks:
      - unit-test-simple
    - "on":
        pull_request:
          chatops:
          - test
      tasks:
      - unit-test-simple
    ```

    The first action triggers the `unit-test-simple` task upon creating/updating a pull request. The second action triggers `unit-test-simple` whenever a comment `/test` is made on the pull request.

Hence, The entire `Dispatchfile` becomes:

```bash
cat <<EOF | > Dispatchfile
#!mesosphere/dispatch-yaml:v0.3

resource:
  docker-image:
    param:
      digest: $(inputs.resources.docker-image.digest)
      url: docker.io/$YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
    type: image
  helloworld-git:
    param:
      revision: $(context.git.commit)
      url: $(context.git.url)
    type: git

task:
  build:
    inputs:
    - helloworld-git
    outputs:
    - docker-image
    steps:
    - args:
      - --destination=$(outputs.resources.docker-image.url)
      - --context=/workspace/helloworld-git
      - --oci-layout-path=/workspace/output/docker-image
      - --dockerfile=/workspace/helloworld-git/Dockerfile
      image: chhsiao/kaniko-executor
      name: build-and-push
      resources: {}
  unit-test-simple:
    inputs:
    - docker-image
    - helloworld-git
    steps:
    - command:
      - go
      - test
      - ./...
      image: $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
      name: unit-test-simple
      resources: {}
      workingDir: /workspace/helloworld-git/

actions:
- "on":
    pull_request: {}
  tasks:
  - unit-test-simple
- "on":
    pull_request:
      chatops:
      - test
  tasks:
  - unit-test-simple
EOF
```

You can use the Dispatch CLI to validate above Dispatchfile:

```bash
dispatch ci render --file=Dispatchfile
```

which would result in an output similar to:

```yaml
...
#!yaml
# vi:syntax=yaml

actions:
- "on":
    pull_request: {}
  tasks:
  - unit-test-simple
- "on":
    pull_request:
      chatops:
      - test
  tasks:
  - unit-test-simple
resource:
  $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld:
    param:
      digest: $(inputs.resources.$YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld.digest)
      url: $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
    type: image
  helloworld-git:
    param:
      revision: $(context.git.commit)
      url: $(context.git.url)
    type: git
task:
  $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld:
    inputs:
    - helloworld-git
    outputs:
    - $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld
    steps:
    - args:
      - --destination=$YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
      - --context=/workspace/helloworld-git/
      - --oci-layout-path=/workspace/output/$YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld
      - --dockerfile=/workspace/helloworld-git/Dockerfile
      image: chhsiao/kaniko-executor
      name: docker-build
      resources: {}
  unit-test-simple:
    inputs:
    - $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME-helloworld
    steps:
    - command:
      - go
      - test
      - ./...
      image: $YOURDOCKERUSERNAME/helloworld:$(context.build.name)
      name: unit-test-docker
      resources: {}
      workingDir: /test
```

See full reference of a [Dispatchfile](../../references/pipeline-config-ref/).

After setting up dispatch, adding relevant credentials, and creating `helloworld` repository, we can move on to running our CI.

# Continuous Integration in Action

After creating your `Dispatchfile`, you can push it to a branch of your choice and create a pull request against default branch (or any branch).
When you executed the `dispatch ci create repository` command in earlier sections, `Dispatch` repository controller created a [webhook in your GitHub repository](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/). This webhook enables Dispatch to receive events (such as pull request events) from GitHub. When you create a Pull Request, a `PullRequest` event is posted to `Dispatch` and this in turn triggers a pipeline to run `unit-test-simple` task as declared in your `Dispatchfile`. If you make a comment on the pull request that starts with `/test` then this would have a similar effect (useful in cases where you want to rerun a flaky CI test). Make such a comment and the build status should be reflected shortly on your Pull Request as soon as the build is scheduled. See [the troubleshooting guide](../../troubleshooting/) if you are having problems.

You can look at [logs](../../operations/logging) of various dispatch components as well as pipelines.
