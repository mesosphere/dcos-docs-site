## v1.2.1 - Released June 26, 2020
Document Modified Date: June 26, 2020

This document describes the new features, caveats, and resolved issues of D2iQ Dispatch.

### Installation and Upgrades

To install Dispatch, follow one of the two options below:
- **Installation**: Run `konvoy init` and then update the `configVersion` for `https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch` in your `cluster.yaml`. 

- **Upgrade**: Update the `configVersion` for `https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch` in your `cluster.yaml` .

1. Update the following *example* snippet from `cluster.yaml` to upgrade from Dispatch v1.1.0 to 1.2.0.

```yaml
  - configRepository: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch
    configVersion: stable-1.16-1.2.0
    addonsList:
    - name: dispatch
      enabled: false
```

It should read:

```yaml
  - configRepository: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch
    configVersion: stable-1.16-1.2.1
    addonsList:
    - name: dispatch
      enabled: true
```

2. Apply the configuration to install/upgrade Dispatch to the Konvoy cluster.
```
konvoy up
```

3. Verify that the installation/upgrade is successful.
```
helm test dispatch-kubeaddons
```

### Improvements since v1.2.0

### Caveats

### Resolved Issues

* Fixed a bug where the garbage collector only reclaims resources in the last watched namespace.
* Fixed a bug where login commands should ignore existing `basic-auth` secrets on a service account if it has a different annotation type. For example, `login github` should ignore `login docker`'s secrets as they have different annotations.
