Here are step-by-step tutorials for performing some common deployment-related tasks using Dispatch. All tutorials begin with a "Prerequisites" section that contains links to any steps that need to be taken first. This means you can visit any tutorial to get started. All tutorials assume you have read through and followed the instructions on the [Quickstart](../../../quickstart/) or [Pipeline Configuration tutorials](../../ci_tutorials/).

# Tutorials

## Continuous Deployment with GitOps
