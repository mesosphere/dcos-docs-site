# Deploying Applications with GitOps

Dispatch enables software and applications to be continuously deployed (CD) using GitOps processes. GitOps enables the application to be deployed as per a manifest that is stored in a Git repository.  This ensures that the application deployment can be automated, audited and declaratively deployed to the infrastructure.
