### Improvements

* Starlark frontend now supports imports.
* EXPERIMENTAL Starlark standard libraries via the [Dispatch Catalog](https://github.com/mesosphere/dispatch-catalog) for Dispatchfiles.
* Added support for lambdas and nested function definitions in Starlark.
* Added Dispatchfile versioning to improve backward compatibility.
* Preserved artifacts generated by failed tasks.
* Enable MinIO scaling & HA capabilities.
* Added Dispatch dashboard to UI
* PipelineRun viewable in Dispatch dashboard.
* Standard output from steps now produces result variables that can be consumed by other tasks.
* Adopted Tekton v1beta1 API.
* Supported private repository authentication from the CLI.
* Added `dispatch ci artifacts list` and `dispatch ci artifacts fetch` commands to list and fetch artifacts of a 
pipeline.
* Added `dispatch ci gen-doc` command to generate documentation from Starlark files.
* `dispatch ci run remote` now supports `--dry-run` to print resulting Tekton YAML manifests.
* `dispatch ci list pipelineruns` and `dispatch ci list tasks --pipelinerun=<name>` now shows the status of the taskruns.
* Periodically garbage-collect persistent task logs.
* Added options to skip TLS verifications for self-signed certificates.
* Added GitopsRepository CRD.
* Added `dispatch gitops cert` command and new options to `dispatch gitops creds` command to manage Git server TLS certificates and SSH known hosts for ArgoCD.
* Upgraded Tekton to v0.11.1.
* Upgraded ArgoCD to v1.5.2.

### Caveats

* `dispatch ci run remote` now requires `--service-account` to be specified and no longer defaults to build-bot.
* `dispatch ci run` now requires `--task` to be specified.
* The `dispatch ci list pipelineruns` and `dispatch ci list tasks` commands of older versions of Dispatch CLI (1.0.0 or earlier) no longer work with Dispatch 1.1.0 installations. New CLI command is backwards compatible with older installations.

* `dispatch gitops app create` no longer overwrites argocd-secret.
* `update-gitops-repo` no longer fails when the specified branch already exists.
* Secrets can now be used to checkout source code residing in a Gitlab repository.
* update-gitops-repo now supports Gitops repositories hosted on GitLab.
* Do not collect unused standard outputs from task steps to avoid Tekton controller crashes.
* Users can now delete secrets created by CLI through Dispatch UI.
* Fixed status reporting on pull requests where the repository owner or repository name contains non-alphanumeric characters.
* Fixed UI failures when secrets or service accounts are missing.
* Fixed Tekton dashboard crashes when certain k8s resources are deleted on a busy cluster.
* Fixed UI authentication issue by sending impersonate group headers in k8s API requests.
* Re-run pipelines now includes correct dashboard links in Dispatch UI.
* Nolonger required to specify -n dispatch for `dispatch ci list` command.
* Fixed Docker-in-Docker hangs during termination.
* Re-run pipelines now includes correct dashboard links in commit status reports.
* Listing pipelineruns using `dispatch ci list pipelineruns` now honors user RBAC.
