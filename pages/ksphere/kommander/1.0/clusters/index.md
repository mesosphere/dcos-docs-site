## Creating or Connecting Clusters

Kommander allows you to monitor and manage very large numbers of clusters and so we make it easy to either connect existing clusters or create new clusters whose lifecycle is managed by Konvoy.

From the dashboard page or the clusters page, click Add Cluster and Create Konvoy Cluster.

![Add Cluster Options](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/add-cluster.png)

### Creating a Konvoy Cluster

- [Creating Konvoy Clusters on AWS](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/clusters/creating-konvoy-cluster-aws/)
- [Creating Konvoy Clusters on Azure](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/clusters/creating-konvoy-cluster-azure/)
- [Creating Konvoy Clusters on your own infrastructure](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/clusters/creating-konvoy-cluster-on-prem/)

### Connecting an Existing Cluster

Using the Add Cluster option, you can attach an already existing cluster, even an existing Konvoy cluster, directly to Kommander. Enjoy all the multi-cluster management and monitoring benefits that Kommander provides while keeping your existing cluster on its current provider & infrastructure.

See [Attach Cluster](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/clusters/attach-cluster/)

### Creating a Konvoy Cluster via YAML

Clicking the Upload YAML option will allow you to utilize config generated by the Konvoy CLI tool. An example config can be created in the file `cluster.yaml` by running `konvoy init`. Ensure the correct Cloud Provider credentials are selected and add any cluster labels that apply.

![Create Cluster Upload YAML](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/create-cluster-yaml.png)

#### Adding/Removing Cluster Labels

Cluster labels are matched to the selectors created for projects. If a cluster is removed from a project any resources deployed to the cluster from that Project will be removed. If a cluster is added to a project any existing project resources will be deployed to the cluster.

#### Valid labels

- Valid labels must have a key and a value, separated by a colon and a space. For example, "env: dev"
- Valid label keys and values must be alphanumeric and can contain “-”, “\_”, or “.”
- Valid label keys and values must not start or end with “-”, “\_”, or “.”

## Types

There are several types of cluster types to be aware of in the Clusters tab.

- **Attached**: A cluster that was not created with Kommander. Attached clusters' lifecycle cannot be managed.
- **Managed**: A Konvoy cluster that was created with Kommander. Managed clusters' lifecycle can be managed.
- **Management**: The Konvoy cluster that hosts Kommander.

## Upgrading Kubernetes version

You can upgrade Kubernetes version on a running cluster from the Cluster Detail page (Figure 2.)
Select an available desired version from the Version dropdown and confirm your action in the confirmation dialog.

## Editing Clusters

![Edit a Cluster Action](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/edit-cluster-action.png)

### Editing an Attached cluster

For an Attached cluster you can only edit labels that are assigned to it.

![Edit an Attached Cluster](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/edit-cluster-attached.png)

### Editing a Managed cluster

For a Managed cluster you can edit its name, labels, cloud provider tags and its node pools.

![Edit a Cluster Form](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/edit-cluster-form-name.png)

#### Editing a node pool

When editing a node pool, you can only increase the number of nodes in the pool. This is to prevent losing any workloads that are currently running on the cluster.

You can also add labels and taints to a node pool.

![Edit a Cluster Node Pools](/ksphere/kommander/1.0/img/edit-cluster-node-pools.png)

#### Editing labels and cloud provider tags

## Disconnect vs Delete

When you attach a cluster to Kommander that was not created with Kommander, you may later disconnect it. This does not alter the running state of the cluster, but simply removes it from the Kommander UI.

For managed clusters created with Kommander, disconnecting the cluster is not an option, but it can be deleted. This completely removes the cluster and all of its cloud assets.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>
If you delete the management (Konvoy) cluster, you won't be able to use Kommander to delete the managed clusters that were created by Kommander. Be sure and delete any managed clusters before finally deleting the Konvoy cluster if your intention is to delete all clusters.

## Statuses

| Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending        | This is the initial state when a cluster is created or connected.                                                                                                   |
| Loading Data   | The cluster has been added to Kommander and we are fetching details about the cluster. This is the status before `Active`.                                          |

| Join Failed    | This can happen when kubefed does not have permission to create entities in the target cluster.                                                                     |
| Unjoining      | Kubefed cleans up after itself, removing all installed resources on the target cluster.                                                                             |
