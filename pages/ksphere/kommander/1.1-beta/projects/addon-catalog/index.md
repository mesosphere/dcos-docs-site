excerpt: Deploy applications to your Kommander Projects

Kommander can also deploy services from a catalog of current cloud native services with the push of a button. This helps organizations quickly deploy services to multiple clusters. Governance-based access to data services ensures roles and responsibilities are maintained.

Kommander can be extended with the `AddonRepository` resource that point to git repositories containing application addons. For example, the `kubeaddons-enterprise` repo contains addons such as Jenkins and Kafka with specific settings for each cloud provider. Addons can be composed using either Helm V2 charts or KUDO operators.

Example `AddonRepository` resource to add a new repository to your catalog:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeaddons.mesosphere.io/v1beta1
kind: AddonRepository
metadata:
  name: kubeaddons-enterprise
  namespace: project-namespace
spec:
  priority: "20"
  ref: “stable-1.16”
  url: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-enterprise
```

To deploy an addon, select a Project from your Workspace and select the **View Catalog** button to browse the available addons from your configured repositories.

To customize an addon before deploying it, you can customize the helm chart values or KUDO parameters of a service before deploying it.

After an addon is deployed in a project, the service is installed to all clusters in that project.
