## Attach Kubernetes Cluster

Using the **Add Cluster** option, you can attach an already existing cluster, or an existing Konvoy cluster, directly to Kommander. You can access the multi-cluster management and monitoring benefits Kommander provides while keeping your existing cluster on its current provider and infrastructure.

Selecting the **Connect Cluster** option displays the **Connection Information** dialog box. This dialog box accepts a kubeconfig file, that you can paste, or upload into the field. In the **Conext** select list, you can select the intended context or change the display name provided with the config. You can add labels to classify your cluster.
