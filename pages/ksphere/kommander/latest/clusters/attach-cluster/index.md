## Attach Kubernetes Cluster

Using the Add Cluster option, you can attach an already existing cluster, even an existing Konvoy cluster, directly to Kommander. Enjoy all the multi-cluster management and monitoring benefits that Kommander provides while keeping your existing cluster on its current provider & infrastructure.

Clicking the Connect Cluster option will reveal a UI that accepts a kubeconfig file that you may either paste or upload into the form. You can select the intended context from the Context select list or change the display name provided with the config. Add labels to classify your cluster.
