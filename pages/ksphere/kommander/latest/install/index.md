When it comes to installing Konvoy for a project, line-of-business, or enterprise, your first step is to determine the infrastructure on which you want to deploy.

For example, you can:

- Install on a public cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- Install on an internal network with a physical (bare metal) or virtual infrastructure.
- Install on a single laptop with a virtual infrastructure.

The infrastructure you select then determines the specific requirements for a successful installation.
