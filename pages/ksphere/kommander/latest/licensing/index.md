## Licensing

Kommander requires a valid license to continue use beyond adding a second cluster.

The License table shows currently added licenses with name, status, start date, end date, cluster capacity, and secret name.

Licenses

Under the hood, a license consists of a License custom resource object that references a secret containing the actual license text.

Clicking + Add License takes you to the license form where a license can be created by adding the license to the textarea.

If there is an error submitting the license, the error banner contains directions on how to add the license directly through kubectl.
