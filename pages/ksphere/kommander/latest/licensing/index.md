## Purchase a License

Kommander requires a valid license if you want to add more than two clusters. 

To obtain a valid Kommander license, contact your sales representative at <sales@d2iq.com>. After purchase, download the license file from the [support website](https://support.d2iq.com/s/downloads) using your [login credentials](https://support.d2iq.com/s/login/) to a place accessible by Kommander. 

## Enter a Valid License Key 
After you have downloaded the license, an administrator must add it to Kommander.
