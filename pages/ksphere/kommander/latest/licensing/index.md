## Purchase a License

You can evaluate Kommander running two clusters for free. Kommander cluster plus one additional cluster. If you want to add more clusters you need a valid license.

After purchase, download the license file from the [support website](https://support.d2iq.com/s/downloads) using your [login credentials](https://support.d2iq.com/s/login/) to a place accessible by Kommander.

After you have downloaded the license, an administrator must add it to Kommander.
