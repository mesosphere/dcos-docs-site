Role-based authorization can be defined centrally within Kommander to control access to resources on all clusters. The resources are similar to Kubernetes RBAC but with some crucial differences.

#### Types of Access Control Objects

**Groups** map to groups and user claims from your identity providers.

**Roles** are named collections of rules defining which verbs can be applied to which resources.

**Policies** bind a group to a role

Policies

Roles and Policies can be defined in the cluster scope which makes them apply to all Konvoy clusters.

Roles and Policies can be defined within a project and apply only to the clusters matching the project's selector labels.
