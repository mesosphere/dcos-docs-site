## Logging in with Username and Password

By default, you login to konvoy with a credential given by `konvoy up`. You can retrieve it later by using `konvoy get ops-portal`.

These static credentials should be used only to access **operations portal** for configuring an external identity provider. Since these are static credentials and there is currently no way of updating them they should be treated only as backup credentials and not used for normal access. Always login with own identity from external identity provider that usually provide additional security features like Multi Factor Authentication.

## Identity Providers

To provide simple access for the users of your organization, Identity Providers can be set up.

Currently, Kommander supports **Github**, **LDAP**, and any standard **OIDC** provider such as **Google**. 

You can configure as many Identity Providers as you like and users will be able to select any of those methods when logging in.
