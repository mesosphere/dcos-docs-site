Kommander lets you manage multiple Kubernetes clusters across your entire deployment quickly and seamlessly. Kommander provides a centralized console for deploying, monitoring, and managing production-ready Kubernetes on an enterprise scale.

Kommander provides management and insights for multiple Kubernetes clusters, and supports both Konvoy or non-Konvoy clusters. Kommander includes essential enterprise-grade capabilities such as:

- Powerful user interface optimized to manage multiple clusters
- Automated lifecycle management
- Distributed configuration management

Kommander and Konvoy are separate products. Kommander is free during Beta and will have its own releases, pricing, and roadmap.

Kommander Beta should not be used for production clusters. Kommander's functionality will continue to be refined while in Beta. We welcome you to test out features, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.
