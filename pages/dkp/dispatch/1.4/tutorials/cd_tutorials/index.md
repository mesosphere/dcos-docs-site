# Deploying Applications with GitOps

Dispatch enables software and applications to be continuously deployed (CD) using GitOps processes. GitOps enables the application to be deployed as per a manifest that is stored in a Git repository. This ensures that the application deployment can be automated, audited, and declaratively deployed to the infrastructure.

Here are step-by-step tutorials for performing some common deployment-related tasks using Dispatch. All tutorials begin with a "Prerequisites" section that contains links to any steps that need to be taken first. This means you can visit any tutorial to get started. All tutorials assume you have read through and followed the instructions on the [Quickstart](../../quickstart/index.md) or [Pipeline Configuration tutorials](../ci_tutorials/index.md).
