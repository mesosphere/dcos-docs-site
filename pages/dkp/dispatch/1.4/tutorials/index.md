Tutorials provide easy to follow procedures for leveraging or highlighting specific features within Dispatch. They can be broken down into two areas:

1. [Continuous Integration](ci_tutorials/) tutorials which provide insight into leveraging the abilities of Dispatch to build, test, and deliver applications.
1. [Continuous Deployment](cd_tutorials/) tutorials provide examples for deploying applications into a Kubernetes cluster.
