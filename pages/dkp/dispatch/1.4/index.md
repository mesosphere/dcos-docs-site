excerpt: Dispatch provides a declarative CI/CD platform for rapidly deploying Cloud Native applications and enabling enterprises to rapidly build, test and manage applications' lifecycle using GitOps processes.
---
Dispatch is a cloud-native GitOps platform. GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery; it works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. Dispatch enables you to:

* Define and execute build, test, and deployment workflows.
* Implement modern GitOps processes to increase test coverage and speed up your deployments.
* Define your build pipeline using powerful languages using well-known development methodologies, so that you can spend more time writing code and less time maintaining your pipelines.

# Key Features

**Flexible Pipeline Configuration.** Dispatch lets you leverage languages such as CUE and Starlark to declaratively define a build and test [pipeline](overview_concepts/dispatch-ci/). You can reduce pipeline complexity by defining functions, schema validation and other well-known programming constructs.

**Choice of Build Locations.** You can execute your pipeline on your laptop, on-prem cluster or in the public cloud. Dispatch lets you run the same pipeline in any environment.

**Cloud Native.** Dispatch is optimized to run on Kubernetes, using build and deploy services that leverage Kubernetes' underlying services and processes.

**Software Lifecycle as Code.**  Dispatch lets you implement GitOps processes to store build pipelines and application deployment methodologies in Git for repeatable and efficient lifecycle management.
