## v1.2.2 - Released June 15, 2020
Document Modified Date: July 15, 2020

This document describes the new features, caveats, and resolved issues of D2iQ Dispatch.

### Installation and Upgrades

To install Dispatch, follow one of the two options below:
- **Installation**: Run `konvoy init` and then update the `configVersion` for `https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch` in your `cluster.yaml`. 

- **Upgrade**: Update the `configVersion` for `https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch` in your `cluster.yaml` .

1. Update the following *example* snippet from `cluster.yaml` to upgrade from Dispatch v1.2.0 to 1.2.2.

```yaml
  - configRepository: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch
    configVersion: stable-1.16-1.2.0
    addonsList:
    - name: dispatch
      enabled: false
```

It should read:

```yaml
  - configRepository: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons-dispatch
    configVersion: stable-1.16-1.2.2
    addonsList:
    - name: dispatch
      enabled: true
```

2. Apply the configuration to install/upgrade Dispatch to the Konvoy cluster.
```
konvoy up
```

3. Verify that the installation/upgrade is successful.
```
helm test dispatch-kubeaddons
```
