### Edit an attached cluster

For an attached cluster, you can only edit labels assigned to that cluster.

For a managed cluster, you can edit the following:

- Cloud provider tags
- Node pools.

#### Edit a node pool

When editing a node pool, you can only increase the number of nodes in the pool. This prevents losing any workloads currently running on the cluster.

You can also add labels and taints to a node pool.

#### Edit labels and cloud provider tags
