### KUDO {{ model.addon }} Introduction

Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO) provides a declarative approach to building production-grade Kubernetes [operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).
- KUDO is built to help manage day 2 operations of services on Kubernetes, including stateful services through the management of operators.
- KUDO is built to support upgrades of services along with backup, recovery and the needs of observability.
- KUDO is integrated into Kommander and does not require any [initialization](https://kudo.dev/docs/cli/installation.html#kudo-initialization) via the [KUDO CLI](https://kudo.dev/docs/cli/installation.html#cli-installation)
