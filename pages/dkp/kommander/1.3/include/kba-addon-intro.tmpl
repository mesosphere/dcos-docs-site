## Kubernetes {{ model.addon }}

Kubernetes {{ model.addon }} provide preconfigured day two functionality and services, on top of Kubernetes, like monitoring, logging, and external DNS. The versions are tested against a pure upstream Kubernetes build having no specific D2iQ requirements.

New Minor or Major versions of {{ model.addon }} releases are based on user requirements. These can occur in any release but are less frequent. {{ model.addon }} have their own release numbers that follow a semantic version numbering scheme and includes the version of Kubernetes the {{ mode.addon }} were tested on. For example, `release-<kubernetes version>-<major>.<minor>`.

The version is defined in Konvoyâ€™s `cluster.yaml` definition when [creating](../../quick-start/) or [upgrading](../../upgrade/) a Konvoy cluster. {{ model.addon }} are tested against more than one Kubernetes version.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>
When adding the Kubernetes {{ model.addon }} to your <code>cluster.yaml</code> file, to install or upgrade your {{ model.addon }}, ensure you use the argument that corresponds to your Kubernetes version, For example,
<a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-base-addons/releases/tag/testing-1.19-3.2.0" target="_blank">testing-1.19-3.2.0</a> would be Kubernetes 1.17.x.</p>
