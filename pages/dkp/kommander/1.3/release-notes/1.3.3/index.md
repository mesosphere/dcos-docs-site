# Release Summary
Kommander provides a command center for all your cloud native management needs in public Information as a Service (IaaS), on-premises, and edge environments. Kommander provides a multi-tenant experience to create, secure, and configure Kubernetes clusters and cloud native workloads. Additionally, Kommander enables teams to unlock federated cost management across multiple clusters, whether they are a new Konvoy cluster or an existing 3rd party/DIY distribution installation.

# Known issues

In versions prior to 1.3.3, Kubecost cost-analyzer by default requests a PVC of size 0.2Gi. This may cause issues with certain provisioners that require a minimum storage size of 1Gi. To resolve this issue, upgrade to 1.3.3 following the upgrade instructions below.

## Upgrading
The default cost-analyzer persistent volume size has been increased to 32Gi. Upgrades may require manual intervention if your provisioner does not support volume expansion. Here are some recommendations from the [Kubecost storage documentation](https://github.com/kubecost/docs/blob/master/storage.md):

**If you are upgrading an existing version of Kommander**
  - If your provisioner does supports volume expansion, we will automatically resize you to a 32GB disk in an upgrade.
  - If your provisioner does not support volume expansion:
    - If you have not added or modified Kubecost configuration from the settings page on the Kubecost frontend, you can safely delete the PV and upgrade.
      - We suggest you delete the old PV, then upgrade Kommander.
    - If you cannot safely delete the PV storing your configs and configure them on a new PV:
      - If you are not on a regional cluster, we recommend that you provision a second PV by setting `kubecost.cost-analyzer.persistentVolume.dbPVEnabled=true` in your cluster.yaml under Kommander values.
      - If you are on a regional cluster,  we recommend that you provision a second PV using a topology-aware storage class ([more info](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/11/topology-aware-volume-provisioning-in-kubernetes/#getting-started)). You can set this diskâ€™s storage class by setting `kubecost.cost-analyzer.persistentVolume.dbStorageClass=<your-topology-aware-storage-class-name>`.

# Bug fixes

- UI: Resolved kubecost performance issue.
- Increased the default Kubecost cost-analyzer PVC storage size from 0.2Gi to 32Gi to resolve deployment issues that occurred with provisioners that require a minimum size of 1Gi. See Upgrading above if upgrading from a previous version. (COPS-6937)
