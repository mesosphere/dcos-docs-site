Kommander includes powerful features for operating on multiple clusters with advanced configuration. You can connect multiple infrastructure providers, integrate your organization's identity provider, such as a directory service or Github, and map those providers' groups to fit your clusters' access requirements. See the detailed sub-sections for more information.
