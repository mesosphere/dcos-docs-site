Kommander is also an addon running on a Konvoy cluster. It is updated in the same way as every [Konvoy addon is upgraded][addons-upgrade].

When upgrading Kommander, use the equivalent [new version of the Konvoy CLI and update][konvoy-upgrade] for your `cluster.yaml` file according to the instructions. Confirm that you are using the configVersion for [Kommander that matches the version of the Konvoy CLI][version-support-policy] you are deploying.
