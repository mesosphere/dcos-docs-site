# Introducing Workspaces

Workspaces give you the flexibility to represent your organization in a way that makes sense for your team and configuration.

For example, you can create separate workspaces for each department, product, or business function. Each workspace manages their own clusters and role-based permissions, while retaining an overall organization-level view of all clusters in operation.

## Global / Workspace UI

The UI is designed to be accessible for different roles:

At the top level, **Global**, IT administrators manage all clusters across all workspaces.

At the **Workspace** level, devops administrators manage multiple clusters within a workspace.

At the **Projects** level, devops administrators or developers manage configuration and services across multiple clusters.

## Default Workspace

To get started immediately, you can use the default workspace deployed in Kommander. Your workspace delegation can be done at a later time.

# Workspace Procedures

- [Create new workspaces](create-workspaces/)
- [Edit and delete workspaces](edit-delete-workspaces)
