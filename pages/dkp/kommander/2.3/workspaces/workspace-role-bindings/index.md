Workspace Role Bindings grant access to a specified Project Role for a specified group of people.

## Configure Workspace Role Bindings

Before you can create a Workspace Role Binding, ensure you have created a Group. A Kommander Group can contain one or several Identity Provider users, groups or both.

You can assign a role to this Kommander Group:

1.  From the top menu bar, select your target workspace.

1.  Select **Access Control** in the **Administration** section of the sidebar menu.

1.  Select the **Cluster Role Bindings** tab, and then select the **Add Roles** button next to the group you want.

1.  Select the Role, or Roles, you want from the drop-down menu and select **Save**.
