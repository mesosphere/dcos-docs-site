## Deploying Applications with GitOps

Kommander enables software and applications to be continuously delivered (CD) using GitOps processes. GitOps enables you to deploy an application according to a manifest that is stored in a Git repository. This ensures that the application deployment can be automated, audited, and declaratively deployed to the infrastructure.

This section contains step-by-step tutorials for performing some common deployment-related tasks using Kommander. All tutorials begin with a "Prerequisites" section that contains links to any steps that need to be taken first. This means you can visit any tutorial to get started.
