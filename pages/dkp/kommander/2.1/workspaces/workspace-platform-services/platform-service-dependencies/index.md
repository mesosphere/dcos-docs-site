excerpt: Dependencies between workspace applications
---

There are many dependencies between the platform applications that are deployed to a workspace's attached clusters. It is important to note these dependencies when customizing the workspace platform applications to ensure that your applications are properly deployed to the clusters. For more information on how to customize workspace platform applications, see [Workspace Platform Applications](../../workspace-platform-services#customize-a-workspaces-applications).

## Platform Application Dependencies

When deploying or troubleshooting platform applications, it helps to understand how platform applications interact and may require other platform applications as dependencies.

If a platform applicationâ€™s dependency does not successfully deploy, the platform application requiring that dependency does not successfully deploy.

The following sections detail information about the workspace platform application.

### Foundational Applications

Provides the foundation for all platform application capabilities and deployments on managed clusters. These applications must be enabled for any platform applications to work properly.

The foundational applications are comprised of the following platform application:

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs): Automates TLS certificate management and issuance.
- [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader): A controller that watches changes on ConfigMaps and Secrets, and automatically triggers updates on the dependent applications.
- [traefik](https://traefik.io/): Provides an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Requires cert-manager and reloader.

| **Platform Application** | **Dependencies**       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| cert-manager             |                        |
| reloader                 |                        |
| traefik                  | cert-manager, reloader |

### Logging

Collects logs over time from Kubernetes and applications deployed on managed clusters. Also provides the ability to visualize and query the aggregated logs.

- [grafana-loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/): A horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
- [grafana-logging](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/): Logging dashboard used to view logs aggregated to Grafana Loki.
- [logging-operator](https://banzaicloud.com/docs/one-eye/logging-operator/): Automates the deployment and configuration of a Kubernetes logging pipeline.
- [minio-operator](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/README.md): A Kubernetes-native high performance object store with an S3-compatible API that supports deploying MinIO Tenants onto private and public cloud infrastructures.
- [fluent-bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/): Open source and multi-platform log processor tool which aims to be a generic Swiss knife for logs processing and distribution.

| **Platform Application** | **Dependencies** |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| grafana-loki             | minio-operator   |
| grafana-logging          | grafana-loki     |

| minio-operator           |                  |
| fluent-bit               |                  |

### Monitoring

Provides monitoring capabilities by collecting metrics, including cost metrics, for Kubernetes and applications deployed on managed clusters. Also provides visualization of metrics and evaluates rule expressions to trigger alerts when specific conditions are observed.

-   [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack): A stack of applications that collect metrics and provide visualization and alerting capabilities.
    <p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong><a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager">Prometheus Alertmanager</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com">Grafana</a> are included in the bundled installation.</p>
-   [prometheus-adapter](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter): Provides cluster metrics from Prometheus.
-   [kubecost](https://kubecost.com): provides real-time cost visibility and insights for teams using Kubernetes, helping you continuously reduce your cloud costs.
-   [kubernetes-dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/): A general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.
-   [nvidia](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:k8s:dcgm-exporter): A suite of tools for managing and monitoring NVIDIA datacenter GPUs in cluster environments. Includes active health monitoring, comprehensive diagnostics, system alerts, and governance policies including power and clock management.

| **Platform Application** | Dependencies          |
