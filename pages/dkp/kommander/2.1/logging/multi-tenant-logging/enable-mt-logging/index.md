Before you begin, you must:

## Multi-tenant logging enablement process

The steps required to enable multi-tenant logging include:

1. [Create a Project.](../../multi-tenant-logging/create-project-for-logging)
1. [Create the required Project-level AppDeployments.](../../multi-tenant-logging/create-appdeployment)
1. [Verify that the Project logging stack is installed.](../../multi-tenant-logging/verify-proj-logstack-install)
1. [View a Project's log data.](../../multi-tenant-logging/view-proj-logdata)

Get started with multi-tenant logging by [creating a project][create-project-logging].
