[FluentBit](https://fluentbit.io/) is the DKP choice of open-source log collection and forwarding tool.

## Audit Log Collection

[Auditing](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/) in Kubernetes provides a way to chronologically document the actions taken on a cluster. On Kommander, by default, audit logs are collected and stored for quick indexing. Viewing and accessing can be done via the Grafana logging UI.
