excerpt: Use Project Deployments to manage GitOps based Continuous Deployments
---

You can configure Kommander Projects with GitOps-based Continuous Deployments for federation of your Applications to associated clusters of the project. This is backed by Flux, which enables software and applications to be continuously deployed (CD) using GitOps processes. GitOps enables the application to be deployed as per a manifest that is stored in a Git repository. This ensures that the application deployment can be automated, audited, and declaratively deployed to the infrastructure.
