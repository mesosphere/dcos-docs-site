In addition to viewing the current GitOps Sources, you can also view the current Helm Releases that have been deployed.

On the **Continuous Deployment (CD)** page, select the **Helm Releases** button. All of the current Helm Release charts are displayed with their Chart Version and the names of the clusters. In this example _daily_ is the name of the current cluster being displayed.
