Custom applications are any third-party applications that are not provided in the D2iQ Application Catalog. Custom applications can leverage applications from the D2iQ Catalog or be fully-customized. There is no expectation of support by D2iQ for a Custom application. Custom applications can be deployed on Konvoy clusters or on any D2iQ supported 3rd party Kubernetes distribution.
