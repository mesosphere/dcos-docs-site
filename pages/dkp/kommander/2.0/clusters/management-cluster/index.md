excerpt: A guide to the Management Cluster
---

When you install Kommander, the host cluster is attached in the Kommander Workspace as the Management Cluster. This allows the Management Cluster to be included in [Projects](../../projects/)<!-- and enables the management of its [Platform Services](../../workspaces/workspace-platform-services/) from the Kommander Workspace-->.

## Editing

As an attached cluster, you can edit the Management Cluster to add or remove Labels, then you can use these labels to include the Management Cluster in Projects inside of the Kommander Workspace.

## Disconnecting

The Management Cluster cannot be disconnected from the GUI like other attached clusters. Because of this, the Kommander Workspace cannot be deleted from the GUI as it will always have the Management Cluster inside itself.
