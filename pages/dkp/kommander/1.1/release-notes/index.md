## New Features and Capabilities in Kommander 1.1.0

Kommander 1.1.0 was released on 16, July 2020.

### Centralized Cost Monitoring

Kubecost, running on Kommander, provides centralized cost monitoring for all managed clusters. This feature, installed by default in every Kommander cluster, provides a centralized view of Kubernetes resources used on all managed clusters. For more information go to [Centralized Cost Monitoring](/dkp/kommander/1.1/centralized-cost-monitoring/)

### Automatic Federation of AuthN/Z and Monitoring Stack

When attaching non-Konvoy clusters, such as Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and On-Premises Kubernetes clusters, Kommander will federate a subset of standard Konvoy Addons and charts to enable SSO, AuthN/Z, observability, and cost monitoring.

### Improved RBAC

Kommander has enhanced Access Controls for users at the global, workspace, and project levels allowing greater flexibility and security when assigning roles. See [Granting Access to Kubernetes Resources in Kommander](/dkp/kommander/1.1/tutorials/configure-rbac/)
