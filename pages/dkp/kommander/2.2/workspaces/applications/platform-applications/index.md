excerpt: How workspace platform applications work
---

When attaching a cluster, Kommander deploys certain platform applications on the newly attached cluster. Operators can use the DKP UI to customize which platform applications to deploy to the attached clusters in a given workspace.

Currently, the monitoring stack is deployed by default. The logging stack is not.

Review the [workspace platform application resource requirements](./platform-application-requirements/) to ensure that the attached clusters have sufficient resources.

When deploying and upgrading applications, platform applications come as a bundle; they are tested as a single unit and you must deploy or upgrade them in a single process, for each workspace. This means all clusters in a workspace have the same set and versions of platform applications deployed.

### Customize a workspace's applications

You can customize the applications that are deployed to a workspace's clusters using the DKP UI:

1.  From the top menu bar, select your target workspace.

1.  Select **Applications** from the sidebar menu to browse all applications that can be deployed or uninstalled.

To use the CLI to deploy or uninstall applications, see [Application Deployment](./application-deployment)

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>There may be dependencies between the applications, which are listed <a href="./platform-application-dependencies/">in the workspace platform application dependencies</a> documentation. Review them carefully prior to customizing to ensure that the applications are deployed successfully.</p>

## Workspace platform applications

The following table describes the list of platform applications that are deployed on attachment:

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Currently, Kommander only supports a single deployment of <code>cert-manager</code> per cluster. Because of this, <code>cert-manager</code> cannot be installed on <code>Konvoy</code> managed <code>AWS</code> clusters.</p>

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Kommander automatically manages the deployment of <code>traefik-forward-auth</code> and <code>kube-oidc-proxy</code> when clusters are attached to the workspace. These applications are not shown in the DKP UI.</p>

## Upgrade Platform applications from the CLI

The [DKP upgrade](../../../dkp-upgrade) process deploys and upgrades Platform applications as a bundle for each cluster or workspace. For the Management Cluster or workspace, DKP upgrade handles all Platform applications; no other steps are necessary to upgrade the Platform application bundle. However, for managed or attached clusters or workspaces, you MUST manually upgrade the Platform applications bundle with the following command.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you are upgrading your Platform applications as part of the <a href="../../../dkp-upgrade">DKP upgrade</a>, upgrade your Platform applications on any additional Workspaces before proceeding with the Konvoy upgrade. Some applications in the previous release are not compatible with the <a href="../../../release-notes/">Kubernetes version</a> of this release, and upgrading Kubernetes is part of the DKP Konvoy upgrade process.
</p>

Use this command to upgrade all platform applications in the given workspace and its projects to the same version as platform applications running on the management cluster:

```bash
dkp upgrade workspace WORKSPACE_NAME [--dry-run] [flags]
```
