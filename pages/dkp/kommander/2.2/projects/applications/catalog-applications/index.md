Catalog applications are any third-party or open source applications that appear in the Catalog. These can be DKP applications provided by D2iQ for use in your environment, or [Custom Applications](custom-applications) that can be used but are not supported by D2iQ.

## Upgrade catalog applications

Before upgrading your catalog applications, verify the current and supported versions of the application.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Catalog applications must be upgraded to the latest version BEFORE upgrading the Kubernetes version (or Konvoy version for managed Konvoy clusters) on attached clusters, due to the previous versions' incompatibility with Kubernetes 1.22.</p>
