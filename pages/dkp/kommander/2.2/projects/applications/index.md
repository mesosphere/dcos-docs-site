This section documents the applications and application types that you can utilize with Kommander.

Application types are:

-   [Catalog Applications](catalog-applications) are either pre-packaged applications from the D2iQ Application Catalog, or custom applications that you maintain for your teams or organization.
    - [DKP Applications](catalog-applications/dkp-applications) are applications that are provided by D2iQ and added to the Catalog.
    - [Custom Applications](catalog-applications/custom-applications) are applications you create and add to the Catalog.
-   [Platform Applications](platform-applications) are applications integrated into Kommander.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: When deploying and upgrading applications, platform applications come as a bundle; they are tested as a single unit and you must deploy or upgrade them in a single process, for each workspace. This means all clusters in a workspace have the same set and version of platform applications deployed. Whereas catalog applications are individual, so you can deploy and upgrade them individually, for each project.</p>
