After you deploy a DKP cluster and the platform applications you want to use, you are ready to begin managing cluster operations and its application workloads to optimize your organization's productivity.

In most cases, a production cluster requires additional advanced configuration tailored for your environment, ongoing maintenance, authentication and authorization, and other common activities. For example, it is important to monitor cluster activity and collect metrics to ensure application performance and response time, evaluate network traffic patterns, manage user access to services, and verify workload distribution and efficiency.
