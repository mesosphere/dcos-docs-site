This section describes how to upgrade your Kommander Management cluster and all its Platform Applications to the latest versions. Kommander is installed on your Management cluster and upgrading it must be the first step you take when upgrading DKP, to prevent compatibility issues.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>It is important to upgrade Kommander BEFORE upgrading the Kubernetes version (or Konvoy version for Managed Konvoy clusters) in attached clusters, due to the previous versions' incompatibility with 1.22.</p>

## Prerequisites

- [Download][download-binary] and install the latest DKP CLI binary on your computer.
- Ensure you are on DKP version 2.1 or 2.1.1 and Kubernetes version 1.21.
- If you have attached clusters, ensure they are on Kubernetes versions 1.19, 1.20 or 1.21. To upgrade your Kubernetes version, refer to [AKS][AKS], [AWS][AWS], [Azure][Azure], [EKS][EKS], [pre-provisioned][pre-provisioned] documentation.
- Review the [Platform Application version updates][platform-apps] that are part of this upgrade.

## Upgrade Kommander

1.  Before running the commands below, ensure that your `dkp` configuration **references the cluster on which you want to install Kommander**, otherwise it will install on the bootstrap cluster. You can do this by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable [to the appropriate kubeconfig file's location][k8s-access-to-clusters].

    <p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> An alternative to initializing the KUBECONFIG environment variable as stated earlier is to use the <code>â€“kubeconfig=cluster_name.conf</code> flag. This ensures that Kommander is installed on the workload cluster.</p>

1.  Use the DKP CLI to upgrade Kommander and all the Platform Applications in the Management cluster:

    ```bash
    dkp upgrade kommander
    ```

    <A confirmation message appears once upgrade is complete.>

1.  <Pending step: if confirmation message cannot be added on time, document a way to check the status of the upgrade in Management cluster.>

1.  If your environment has additional Workspaces (Managed and Attached clusters), upgrade your [Workspaces and their Platform applications][upgrade-workspaces] on a per-Workspace basis. If you only have a Management cluster, proceed with [Konvoy Upgrade][konvoy-upgrade].
