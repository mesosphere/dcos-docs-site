<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Insights are refreshed on a 72-hour basis.</p>

Once the [Insights Engine is Enabled](../insights-setup/) select one of your workspaces to view your insight items. From a Workspace Dashboard, the Insights summary table, below the workspace summary cards, displays the most recent insight items. You can toggle the view between Critical, Warning, Notices, and View All for a summary of insight items.

Select Insights from the sidebar menu for the DKP Insights dashboard, where you can filter the insight items several different ways:

-   Use the search dialog to search by description keyword.
-   Toggle your view by the following insight types:
    - All types
    - Availability
    - Best Practices
    - Configuration
    - Cost
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Upgrade
    - Environment
-   Select All Clusters or an individual cluster.
-   Select All Projects or an individual project.
-   Toggle between All, Critical, Warning, and Notices.

To clear filters and reset your view to all insight items, select Clear All.

Insight items usage tips:

- To flag individual insights as useful, select the thumbs-up icon. This notifies the Insights Engine that you find this type of insight useful and helps customize your experience over time.
- For an insight item that is not useful, select the vertical 3-dot menu for that insight item and select Snooze. This only snoozes the individual insight; if the issue recurs, a new insight item displays in the table.
