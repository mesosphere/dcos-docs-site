For all hosts that are part of the cluster, except the **deploy host**, verify the following:

- A [supported operating system](../../install/supported-operating-systems) is installed.
- Firewalld is disabled.
- Containerd is uninstalled.
- Docker-ce is uninstalled.
- Swap is disabled.
- The hostnames for all the machines in the Kubernetes cluster are unique within a single cluster.
- If you are using the XFS file system for the volume that mounts the /var/lib/containerd/ directory, it must be formatted with the `ftype=1` option.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong> This is the default in most OS distributions. You can use the <code>xfs_info</code> utility to verify that <code>ftype=1</code> has been used.</p>
