After you deploy a Konvoy cluster and the platform services you want to use, you are ready to begin managing cluster operations and its application workloads to optimize your organization's productivity.

In most cases, a production cluster requires additional advanced configuration tailored for your environment, ongoing maintenance, and other common activities.
For example, it is important to monitor cluster activity and collect metrics to ensure application performance and response time, evaluate network traffic patterns, manage user access to services, and verify workload distribution and efficiency.
