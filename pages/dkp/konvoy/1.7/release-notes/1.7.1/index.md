## Release summary

This release provides new features and enhancements to improve the user experience, fix reported issues, integrate changes from previous releases, and maintain compatibility and support for other packages used in Konvoy.

### Supported versions

| Kubernetes Support | Version |
| ------------------ | ------- |
|**Minimum** | 1.17.x |
|**Maximum** | 1.19.x |
|**Default** | 1.19.8 |

### New features and capabilities

#### Ansible

- Fix an error when `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` is not defined and SSH key is only provided in the `ssh-agent`.
- Use the correct `k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.2` image.

#### Airgapped

- Include the missing `docker.io/mesosphere/pause:3.2` image needed for air-gapped FIPS installation.

#### Updated the Let's Encrypt tutorial

The [Setting up Let's Encrypt certificate](../../access-authentication/letsencrypt) tutorial has been updated to reflect changes introduced with `cert-manager v.1`.

#### Fixed vSphere machine creation issues in airgapped environments

Previously, in airgapped environments, Terraform would not create new vSphere machines if it did not find a default gateway. With this release, Terraform no longer waits to find a default gateway nor does it check IP addresses with any discovered default gateways before creating new machines.

#### CentOS 7.9 support

This version update now supports the CentOS operating system version 7.9.

#### Create a cluster with no workers

In certain environments, attempting to create a cluster without workers can fail. This should not be a failure state. This version update can now create clusters with no workers. These clusters can be scaled up with workers at a later time or scaled down to zero without issue.

#### Fix deleting certain files during shutdown or reset

A problem with the `konvoy down` or `konvoy reset` commands failing if dedicated named devices were mounted on `/var/lib/kublet` or `/var/lib/containerd` has been corrected. (COPS-6771)

#### Fix issue reporting incorrect status update of addons upon deploying

There was an issue where some Addons were marked as "OK" status when not all components of that addon were available. This happened during the `Deploying Enabled Addons` stage of a `konvoy up` or `konvoy deploy addons` command. This has been fixed and the status now reflects when the addon is ready. (COPS-6883)
