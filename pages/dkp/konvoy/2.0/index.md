Konvoy is a complete, standalone distribution of Kubernetes that enables you to provision native Kubernetes clusters with a suite of [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) and community tools.
By combining the native Kubernetes cluster with all of the components required for operation and lifecycle management, Konvoy provides an out-of-the-box Kubernetes ecosystem that you can install using a single command-line instruction.
