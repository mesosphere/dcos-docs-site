Before you begin using Konvoy, you must have:

-   An unencrypted SSH Private key.

-   The correct image for your target infrastructure Operating system. If your infrastructure is heterogeneous, you must create a separate inventory per Operating System target.

When these prerequisites are in place, you can [prepare your hosts](../prepare-hosts).
