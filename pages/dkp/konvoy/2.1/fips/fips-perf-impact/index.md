The Go language cryptographic module, Goboring, relies on CGOâ€™s foreign function interface to call C-language functions exposed by the cryptographic module. Each call into the C library starts with a base overhead of 200ns.

One [benchmark](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21525) finds that the time to encrypt a single AES-128 block increased from 13ns to 209ns over the internal golang implementation. The preferred mode of D2iQ's FIPS module is `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.

The aggregate impact on a stable control plane seems to be an increase of around 10% CPU utilization over default operation. Workloads that do not directly interact with the control plane are not affected.
