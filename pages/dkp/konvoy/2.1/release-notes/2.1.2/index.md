## Fixes and Improvements

### Upgrade Konvoy 1.8.4 to 2.1.1 index out of range error (COPS-7183)

When attempting to upgrade a Konvoy v1.8 deployment that used an existing VPC, the `prepare-to-adopt` command triggered an error. This problem has been corrected.

<!-- vale Microsoft.HeadingColons = NO -->
### kube-oidc-proxy error: certificate signed by unknown authority (COPS-7217)
<!-- vale Microsoft.HeadingColons = YES -->

A problem that prevented successful configuration of the `kube-oidc-proxy` component when using a custom domain and TLS certificate issued by Let's Encrypt was corrected.

### Konvoy-image-builder 1.7.0 fails in certain situations (COPS-7207)

An issue that resulted in errors like "Failed to connect to the host via ssh" when running konvoy-image-builder v1.7.0 has been corrected. The fix is available in konvoy-image-builder v1.8.0.

### KIB fails to pull images in air-gapped environments  (COPS-7198)
<!-- vale Microsoft.Avoid = NO -->
Running konvoy-image-builder v1.7.0 in air-gapped environments would result in failures to pull docker images if the environment used registry mirrors and/or credentials. The problem is resolved in konvoy-image-builder v1.8.0.
<!-- vale Microsoft.Avoid = YES -->

### Machine stuck in provisioned state after pivot (COPS-7166)

After performing a Pivot operation to migrate cluster resources in DKP 2.1.1, some machines could be stuck in the provisioning state. This issue has been resolved.

### kube-prometheus-stack error during install (COPS-7163)

A problem with Prometheus where the component `kube-prometheus-stack` attempted to upgrade its CRDs to a new version with invalid specifications was resolved.

### HTTP(S)_proxy variables missing from CAPA pods (COPS-7158)

When deploying a 2.1.1 Konvoy cluster, the local environment variables for http_proxy, https_proxy and no_proxy were not propagated to CAPI/CAPI provider pods outside the kube-system namespace, which lead to timeouts in the CAPA pod.

### The Nvidia addon fails to recognize nodes with GPU when GPUs are scarce (COPS-7142)

In DKP 2.x, Nvidia fails to differentiate between nodes with and without a GPU, mistakenly deploying the Nvidia driver and DCGM exporter to every worker node in the cluster.

### Minio CVE-2021-21287 (COPS-7134)

The Minio subchart deployed with Velero has been upgraded to a version that remediates CVE-2021-21287.

### DKP CLI cannot add Azure credentials to a bootstrap cluster (COPS-7108)

An option has been added to the DKP CLI that allows you to add Azure credentials to an existing bootstrap cluster without needing to manually create a secret.

### Prometheus/Grafana kubeaddons cronjob spawns excessive pods (COPS-7105)

As a result of a misconfiguration, the`prometheus-kubeaddons-set-grafana-home-dashboard` can get stuck in a pending state. When this happened, the cronjob associated with Grafana would keep spawning a pod every 5 minutes, which resulted in an excessive number of pods. The Grafana cronjob has been modified to avoid spawning excess pods in this situation.
