### Create a base OS image in the vSphere client

Creating a base OS image from DVD ISO files is a one-time process. Building a base OS image creates a base vSphere template in your vSphere environment. You can use the base OS image template to create a Kubernetes node vSphere template for your cluster.

Refer to the vCenter and vSphere Client documentation for details.

The next step is to [create a vSphere VM template][create-vsphere-template] that contains the CAPI and Kubernetes objects.
