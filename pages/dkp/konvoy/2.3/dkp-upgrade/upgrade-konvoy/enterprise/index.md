## Prerequisites

* Create an [on-demand backup][backup] of your current configuration with Velero.

* Follow the steps listed in the [DKP upgrade overview][dkpup].

* Ensure that all platform applications in the management cluster have been upgraded to avoid compatibility issues with the [Kubernetes version][releasenotes] included in this release. This is done automatically when [upgrading Kommander][upgradekomm], so ensure that you upgrade Kommander prior to upgrading Konvoy.

* For air-gapped: Download the required bundles either at our [support site][supportsite] or by using the CLI.

* For Azure, set the required [environment variables][envariables].

* For AWS, set the required [environment variables][envariables2].

* For vSphere, set the required [environment variables][envariables3].

* For EKS, set the required [environment variables][envariables4].

The following infrastructure environments are supported:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

* Microsoft Azure

* Pre-provisioned environments

* vSphere

* Google Cloud Platform

* EKS

## Overview

To upgrade Konvoy for DKP Enterprise:

1. Upgrade the Cluster API (CAPI) components
1. Upgrade the core addons
1. Upgrade the Kubernetes version

Run all three steps on the management cluster (Kommander cluster) first. Then, run the second and third steps on additional managed clusters (Konvoy clusters), one cluster at a time using the KUBECONFIG configured for each cluster.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> For pre-provisioned air-gapped environments, you must run <code>konvoy-image upload artifacts</code>.</p>

For a full list of DKP Enterprise features, see [DKP Enterprise][dkpenterprise].

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> You must maintain your attached clusters manually. Review the documentation from your cloud provider for more information.</p>

## Upgrade the CAPI components

New versions of DKP come pre-bundled with newer versions of CAPI, newer versions of infrastructure providers, or new infrastructure providers. When using a new version of the DKP CLI, upgrade all of these components first.

If you are running on more than one management cluster (Kommander cluster), you must upgrade the CAPI components on each of these clusters.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>Ensure your <code>dkp</code> configuration references the management cluster where you want to run the upgrade by setting the <code>KUBECONFIG</code> environment variable, or using the <code>--kubeconfig</code> flag, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/">in accordance with Kubernetes conventions</a>.
    

1.  If your cluster was upgraded to 2.1 from 1.8, prepare the old cert-manager installation for upgrade:

    ```bash
    helm -n cert-manager get manifest cert-manager-kubeaddons | kubectl label -f - clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/core=cert-manager
    kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations/cert-manager-kubeaddons-webhook mutatingwebhookconfigurations/cert-manager-kubeaddons-webhook
    ```

1.  For <strong>all</strong> clusters, upgrade capi-components:

    ```bash
    dkp upgrade capi-components
    ```

1.  If your cluster was upgraded to 2.1 from 1.8, remove the remaining old cert-manager resources from 1.8:

    ```bash
    helm -n cert-manager delete cert-manager-kubeaddons
    ```

The command should output something similar to the following:

```sh
✓ Upgrading CAPI components
✓ Waiting for CAPI components to be upgraded
✓ Initializing new CAPI components
✓ Deleting Outdated Global ClusterResourceSets
```

If the upgrade fails, review the prerequisites section and ensure that you've followed the steps in the [DKP upgrade overview][dkpup].
    
    
## Upgrade the core addons

To install the core addons, DKP relies on the `ClusterResourceSet` [Cluster API feature][CAPI]. In the CAPI component upgrade, we deleted the previous set of outdated global `ClusterResourceSets` because prior to DKP 2.3 some addons were installed using a global configuration. In order to support individual cluster upgrades, DKP 2.3 now installs all addons with a unique set of `ClusterResourceSet` and corresponding referenced resources, all named using the cluster’s name as a suffix. For example: `calico-cni-installation-my-aws-cluster`.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you have modified any of the <code>clusterResourceSet</code> definitions, these changes will <strong>not</strong> be preserved when running the command <code>dkp upgrade addons</code>. You must use the <code>--dry-run -o yaml</code> options to save the new configuration to a file and remake the same changes upon each upgrade.</p>

Your cluster comes preconfigured with a few different core addons that provide functionality to your cluster upon creation. These include: CSI, CNI, Cluster Autoscaler, and Node Feature Discovery. New versions of DKP may come pre-bundled with newer versions of these addons. Perform the following steps to update these addons. If you have any additional managed or attached clusters, you will need to upgrade the core addons and Kubernetes version for each one.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>Ensure your <code>dkp</code> configuration references the management cluster where you want to run the upgrade by setting the <code>KUBECONFIG</code> environment variable, or using the <code>--kubeconfig</code> flag, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/">in accordance with Kubernetes conventions</a>.

Upgrade the core addons in a cluster using the 'dkp upgrade addons' command specifying the cluster infrastructure (choose [aws, azure, vsphere, gcp, ek, preprovisioned]) and the name of the cluster.

Examples:

```bash
export CLUSTER_NAME=my-azure-cluster
dkp upgrade addons azure --cluster-name=${CLUSTER_NAME}
```
OR

```bash
export CLUSTER_NAME=my-aws-cluster
dkp upgrade addons aws --cluster-name=${CLUSTER_NAME}
```

The output for the AWS example should be similar to:

```text
Generating addon resources
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/calico-cni-installation-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/calico-cni-installation-my-aws-cluster upgraded
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/tigera-operator-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/tigera-operator-my-aws-cluster upgraded
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/aws-ebs-csi-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/aws-ebs-csi-my-aws-cluster upgraded
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/cluster-autoscaler-my-aws-cluster upgraded
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/node-feature-discovery-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/node-feature-discovery-my-aws-cluster upgraded
clusterresourceset.addons.cluster.x-k8s.io/nvidia-feature-discovery-my-aws-cluster upgraded
configmap/nvidia-feature-discovery-my-aws-cluster upgraded
```

Flags:
    -h, --help  Help for addons

Global Flags:
    -v, --verbose int   Output verbosity

For more information about a command, use:

```sh
dkp ugrade addons [command] --help
```

Once complete, begin upgrading the Kubernetes version.


## Upgrade the Kubernetes version

When upgrading the Kubernetes version of a cluster, first upgrade the control plane and then the node pools. If you have any additional managed or attached clusters, you will need to upgrade the core addons and Kubernetes version for each one.

1. Build a new image if applicable.  
    - If an AMI was specified when initially creating a cluster for AWS, you must build a new one with <a href="/dkp/konvoy/2.3/image-builder/create-ami/">Konvoy Image Builder</a>.
    - If an Azure Machine Image was specified for Azure, you must build a new one with <a href="/dkp/konvoy/2.3/image-builder/create-azure-image/">Konvoy Image Builder</a>.

2. Upgrade the Kubernetes version of the control plane. As shown in update addons section above, replace infrastructure provider name in the command [aws, azure, vsphere, gcp, eks, preprovisioned].

```bash
dkp update controlplane aws --cluster-name=${CLUSTER_NAME} --kubernetes-version=v1.22.8
```

The output should be similar to the below example with the provider name corresponding to the one you entered in the command line:

```text
Updating control plane resource controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=KubeadmControlPlane default/my-aws-cluster-control-plane
Waiting for control plane update to finish.
 ✓ Updating the control plane
```
    
3. Upgrade the Kubernetes version of each of your node pools. Replace `my-nodepool` with the name of the node pool. Also, replace the name of the infrastructure provider in the command [aws, azure, vsphere, gcp, eks, preprovisioned].

```bash
export NODEPOOL_NAME=my-nodepool
dkp update nodepool aws ${NODEPOOL_NAME} --cluster-name=${CLUSTER_NAME} --kubernetes-version=v1.22.8
```
The output should be similar to below with the name of the infrastructure provider shown accordingly:

```text
Updating node pool resource cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=MachineDeployment default/my-aws-cluster-my-nodepool
Waiting for node pool update to finish.
 ✓ Updating the my-aws-cluster-my-nodepool node pool
```
Repeat this step for each additional node pool.
