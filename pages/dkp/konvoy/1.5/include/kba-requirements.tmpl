## Kubernetes Base Addons Requirements

Kubernetes Base Addons (KBA) require more resources than solely deploying clusters. Some addons are prerequisites for others to deploy. Your cluster needs to have sufficient resources when deploying the konvoy cluster, or you must adjust the addons deployed, before running `konvoy up`.

The following table describes all the KBA supplied, by default, with Konvoy, minimum resource suggestions, and their default status when starting Konvoy.
