    -   The "kubernetes-service-monitor" service monitor has been removed. ([#481](https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-base-addons/pull/481), [@gracedo](https://github.com/gracedo))

    -   Bumped Istio to v1.6.8:
        -   Fixed security issues:
            - CVE-2020-12603: By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could cause Envoy to consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/2 requests or responses.
            - CVE-2020-12605: An attacker could cause Envoy to consume excessive amounts of memory when processing specially crafted HTTP/1.1 packets.

            - CVE-2020-12604: An attacker could cause increased memory usage when processing specially crafted packets.
            - CVE-2020-15104: When validating TLS certificates, Envoy incorrectly allows a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name to apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of   .example.com, Envoy incorrectly allows nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com.
            - CVE-2020-16844: Callers to TCP services that have a defined Authorization Policies with DENY actions using wildcard suffixes (e.g. *-some-suffix) for source principals or namespace fields will never be denied access.
        -   Other changes:
            - Fixed return the proper source name after Mixer does a lookup by IP if multiple pods have the same IP.
            - Improved the sidecar injection control based on revision at a per-pod level (Issue 24801)

            - Updated WASM state to log for Access Log Service.
            - Increased default protocol detection timeout from 100 ms to 5 s (Issue 24379)

            - Fixed long log messages for clusters with many gateways.

            - Fixed Galley to properly handle errors from Kubernetes tombstones.
            - Fixed an issue where manually enabling TLS/mTLS for communication between a sidecar and an egress gateway did not work. (Issue 23910)
            - Fixed Bookinfo demo application to verify if a specified namespace exists and if not, use the default namespace.
            - Added a label to the pilot_xds metric in order to give more information on data plane versions without scraping the data plane.
