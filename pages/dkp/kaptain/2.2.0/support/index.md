Kaptain is supported software.
However, the components that are deployed and managed by Kaptain are considered Secondary Software per our [support terms][d2iq-support-terms].
D2iQ provides support for the successful deployment of Kaptain, including ensuring all necessary components are running.

D2iQ does not provide base technology support for the components that are deployed and managed by Kaptain but may be able to recommend a technology partner who can assist.
Any configuration questions and troubleshooting related to the base technology of a Kaptain component that we may provide will be provided on a commercially reasonable basis.
