<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>
You can deploy Kaptain to a cluster in a selected workspace. If you do not intend to deploy Kaptain to a certain cluster, you must switch the workspace you are deploying to or move that cluster to another workspace.
</p>

## DKP 2.2 air-gapped installation

Refer to [DKP install instructions][dkp_install], if you want to deploy Kaptain in a networked environment or to [DKP 2.1 air-gapped instructions][2.1_air] if you are deploying with DKP 2.1.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>All DKP commands in this page assume <code>KUBECONFIG=clusterKubeconfig.conf</code> is set.</p>

Kaptain supports installation on an air-gapped (a.k.a. offline or private) DKP managed cluster. Before installing Kaptain, please follow the [air-gapped installation guide][konvoy-air-gap] to set up the air-gapped DKP managed cluster. The cluster admin is responsible for configuring the DKP cluster correctly and ensuring container images have been pre-loaded to the private registry before installing Kaptain.

## Prerequisites

- [A DKP cluster][dkp-install] with the following Platform applications enabled:

  - Istio
  - Knative (optional, if KServe is configured to work in `RawDeployment` mode)

- [`kubectl`][kubectl] on your installation machine

- For customers deploying in a multi-cluster environment (Enterprise): Ensure you have configured [Kaptain to authenticate with a Management Cluster][dex].

- Ensure the following applications are enabled in Kommander.

  Review the [Kommander installation documentation][kommander-install] for more information.

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: config.kommander.mesosphere.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Installation
      apps:
        ...
        dex:
        dex-k8s-authenticator:
        kube-prometheus-stack:
        istio:
        knative:
        minio-operator:
        traefik:
        nvidia:  # to enable GPU support
        ...
      ```

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Starting from the 1.3 release, Spark Operator is no longer installed by default with Kaptain.</p>

If you need to run Spark jobs on Kubernetes using Spark Operator, you must install it separately. Use the following instructions to install Spark Operator from Kommander Catalog for [DKP 2.x][install-spark-dkp2].

## Add Kaptain to your Kommander Install

Add the Kaptain catalog to the Kommander install configuration file along with the DKP applications catalog:

```yaml
catalog:
---
repositories:
  - name: dkp-catalog-applications
    labels:
      kommander.d2iq.io/gitapps-gitrepository-type: dkp
      kommander.d2iq.io/workspace-default-catalog-repository: "true"
    path: ./dkp-catalog-applications
  - name: kaptain-catalog-applications
    labels:
      kommander.d2iq.io/gitapps-gitrepository-type: dkp
      kommander.d2iq.io/workspace-default-catalog-repository: "true"
    path: ./kaptain-catalog-applications
```

If you added Kaptain after installing DKP, you must make it available by rerunning the Kommander installation with the updated configuration file.

### Load the Docker images into your Docker registry

1.  Download the image bundle file:

    - Download `kaptain-air-gapped-2.1.0.tar.gz` that will contain the required artifacts to perform an air-gapped installation.
    - (Optional) Download the custom image artifacts `kaptain-air-gapped-2.1.0_cpu.tar.gz` or `kaptain-air-gapped-2.1.0_gpu.tar.gz` based on whether you need CPU or GPU for your workloads.

1.  Unpack the bundle and the nested bundle within in a location where you can load and push the images to your private Docker registry.

1.  Ensure you set the `REGISTRY_URL` and `AIRGAPPED_TAR_FILE` variable appropriately, then use the following script to load the air-gapped image bundle and the cpu or gpu bundle:

    ```bash
    dkp push image-bundle --image-bundle ${AIRGAPPED_TAR_FILE} --to-registry ${REGISTRY_URL}
    ```

    _Note: this command is new in DKP 2.2._

    Based on the network latency between the environment of script execution, the Docker registry, and the disk speed, this can take a while to upload all the images to your image registry.

1.  Download the application bundles and chart archive (get links from support)

1.  Extract the application bundle to the location referenced in the Kommander configuration file above.

    ```bash
    mkdir kaptain-catalog-applications
    tar -xvf kaptain-catalog-applications.tar.gz --strip-components 1 -C kaptain-catalog-applications
    ```

1.  Load the Kaptain chart archive after the Kommander installation:

    ```bash
    dkp push chart kaptain-2.1.0.tgz
    ```

## Deploy Kaptain on selected workspaces

You have installed Kaptain by adding it to the DKP Catalog applications. The next step is to enable and deploy Kaptain on all clusters in a selected workspace. For this, refer to [Deploy Kaptain][deploy] instructions.
