# Release Summary

D2iQ is announcing Kaptain 2.1 which includes several user experience features, additional platforms supported, and resolves reported issues. This continues our tradition of customer-led development making Kaptain even easier to deploy, supporting more platforms, and incorporating the latest innovations from the open source community in the hot AI/ML marketplace. Kaptain 2.1 supports Kubeflow 1.5 and a new version of the Kaptain SDK, 1.0.1. For more information on SDK 1.0.1, see [SDK release notes](../../sdk/1.0.x/release-notes).

## New features and capabilities

### Added Kaptain as DKP Catalog application

Starting with Kaptain 2.1, it can be easily installed via the DKP workspace catalog in both single and multi-cluster experiences. Kaptain 2.1 is supported on DKP 2.1.2 onwards.

### Support for Amazon EKS, Azure EKS and DKP multi-cluster

Kaptain 2.1 can be deployed on attached clusters running on Amazon AWS EKS and Microsoft Azure AKS.  This extends D2iQâ€™s openness to support Kubernetes platforms beyond DKP with Kaptain.

### Helm based deployment

Kaptain 2.1 now uses helm based deployment which makes it easier to integrate into DKP and other platforms.

### Support for Kubernetes 1.22 and Kubeflow 1.5

Kaptain 2.1 comes with Kubeflow 1.5, which includes expanded user control over mounted volumes, increased visibility into idle notebooks, UI improvements, and improvements to hyperparameter tuning. Kaptain 2.1 also supports Kubernetes 1.22 which contains upstream improvements such as security enhancements.
