Kaptain offers several ways to train models (incl. distributed), tune hyperparameters, and deploy optimized models that autoscale.

The Kaptain SDK is the best choice for a data science-friendly user experience.
It is designed to be a great first experience with Kaptain.

If you prefer to have full control and are familiar and comfortable with Kubeflow SDKs, or YAML specifications in Kubernetes, then we suggest you consult the other tutorials.

Note that everything can be done from within notebooks, thanks to Kaptain's notebooks-first approach to machine learning.
