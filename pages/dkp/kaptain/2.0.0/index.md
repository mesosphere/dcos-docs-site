Kaptain is a general cloud native, enterprise-grade, and end-to-end AI/ML platform. The product is a set of open
source products, including Kubeflow, with optimized configurations that supports end-to-end machine learning workflows.

Kaptain empowers Data Scientists and ML Engineers to run and scale their entire ML stack with much higher velocity on Kubernetes and Cloud-Native ecosystems.

Kaptain natively integrates Horovod - an open source distributed training framework - to support distributed deep learning across multi-GPU and multi-node clusters. Horovod is compatible with the existing TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet deep learning frameworks and makes distributed Deep Learning super fast and easy.

Kaptain is also pre-configured with Apache Spark, providing the ability to tap into large pools of CPUs and GPUs, on demand.
