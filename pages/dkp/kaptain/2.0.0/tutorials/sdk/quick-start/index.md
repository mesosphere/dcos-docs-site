# Developing and deploying `scikit-learn` models with Kaptain SDK

## Introduction

This notebook shows how to build and deploy ML models by using different popular machine learning frameworks. This example will be based on `scikit-learn` library, but because model building will be handled by Kubernetes Job, you can choose to use any other ML library (that can be installed with `pip`). Currently, the SDK supports XGBoost, Onnx and LightGBM as well as PyTorch and TensorFlow for model deployment. See [Kaptain documentation](https://docs.d2iq.com/dkp/kaptain/) for more info.

To perform [distributed training](../../training/) on a cluster's resources, conduct [experiments with multiple parallel trials](../../katib/) to obtain the best hyperparameters, and [deploying a trained or tuned model](../../pipelines/) typically requires additional steps, such as building a Docker image and providing framework-specific specifications for Kubernetes.
This places the burden on each data scientist to learn all the details of all the components.

Instead of doing all the work, using the Kaptain SDK, you can `train`, `tune`, and `deploy` from within a notebook without having to worry about framework specifics, Kubeflow-native SDKs, or even thinking about Kubernetes

### What You Will Learn

The Kaptain SDK provides a data science-friendly user experience from within a notebook that hides all the specifics, and focuses on the model as the main abstraction.
A model can be trained, tuned, deployed, and tracked.

The example is based on scikit-learn, but it works equally for other data science frameworks.
The original scikit-learn example code can be found in the tutorials [Recognizing hand-written digits](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html).

The SDK relies on [MinIO](https://min.io/), an open-source S3-compliant object storage tool, that is already included with your Kaptain installation.

### What You Will Need

All you need is this notebook.

## Prerequisites

<p class="message--warning"><strong>NOTE: </strong>This notebook requires Kaptain SDK 1.0.0 or later.</p>

Before proceeding, check you are using the correct notebook image, that is, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is available:


```sh
%%sh
set -o errexit
pip list | grep scikit-learn
pip list | grep kaptain
```

## How to Create a Docker Credentials File and Kubernetes Secret

For the tutorial you will need `getpass` to provide a password interactively without it being immediately visible.
It is a standard Python library, so there is no need to install it.
A simple `import` will suffice.

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>Please do not store passwords directly in notebooks.
    Ideally, credentials are stored safely inside secrets management solutions or provided with service accounts.
    Please check the section on <a href="https://docs.d2iq.com/dkp/kaptain/">how to manage secrets</a> in the official Kaptain documentation for more details on how to set up Docker credentials that you can attach to a notebook server.
    This notebook should be used for demonstration purposes only!
</p>

Please type in the container registry username by running the next cell:


```python
import json
import getpass
import pathlib
from base64 import b64encode
```


```python
docker_user = input()
```

Enter the password for the Docker container registry when prompted by executing the following code:


```python
docker_password = getpass.getpass()
```

With these details, base64-encode the username and password and create a Docker configuration file as follows:


```python
# Create a folder to store the Docker configuration file
docker_config_folder = pathlib.Path.joinpath(pathlib.Path.home(), ".docker")
docker_config_folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Write the base64-encoded credentials to the configuration file
docker_credentials = b64encode(f"{docker_user}:{docker_password}".encode()).decode()
config = {"auths": {"https://index.docker.io/v1/": {"auth": docker_credentials}}}
with open(f"{docker_config_folder}/config.json", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(json.dumps(config))
```

## Define the trainer file

This step writes a file that will be run inside of the training container rather than than inside of the notebook kernel. It takes the form of a parameterized training script. The training parameters default inside the training program with the user-defined values being passed in when the container is run. The script is responsible for accessing any datasets that are required for the training run into the container.

To use the Kaptain SDK, you need to add code to do three things to the original model code:
1. In the block at the end of main() to save the trained model to the cluster's built-in object storage, MinIO.
2. Also in the block at the end of main(), to record the metrics of interest.
3. Parameters that will change need to be retrieved from the CLI


```python
%%writefile training.py
import os
import argparse
import time

from sklearn import datasets, svm, metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

from joblib import dump

from kaptain.platform.model_export_util import ModelExportUtil
from kaptain.platform.metadata_util import MetadataUtil


def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    
    # Arguments that will be passed to your training code
    parser.add_argument(
        
        "--gamma",
        type=float,
        default=0.001,
        help="Kernel coefficient"
    )
    
    parser.add_argument(
        "--c",
        type=float,
        default=1.0,
        help="Regularization parameter"
    )
    
    args, _ = parser.parse_known_args()
    
    # Load the MNIST digit dataset
    digits = datasets.load_digits()

    # flatten the images
    n_samples = len(digits.images)
    data = digits.images.reshape((n_samples, -1))

    # Create a classifier: a support vector classifier
    clf = svm.SVC(C=args.c, gamma=args.gamma)

    # Split data into 50% train and 50% test subsets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        data, digits.target, test_size=0.5, shuffle=False
    )

    # Learn the digits on the train subset
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
    predicted = clf.predict(X_test)

    print(
        f"Classification report for classifier {clf}:\n"
        f"{metrics.classification_report(y_test, predicted)}\n"
    )
    
    cm = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, predicted)
    print(f"Confusion matrix:\n{cm}")
    
    score = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"\nModel accuracy: {score}")
    
    model_upload_path = os.getenv("TRAINED_MODEL_UPLOAD_PATH")
    if model_upload_path:
        model_file_name = "model.joblib"

        print(f"Exporting model to {model_upload_path}/{model_file_name} ...")

        dump(clf, model_file_name)
        ModelExportUtil().upload_model(model_file_name)
        print("Export completed.")
        
        # Record model accuracy metrics
        MetadataUtil.record_metrics({"accuracy": score})
        # Because the job executes too quickly, we need to wait to allow metric collector container fetch the metrics
        time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Describe the model

The central abstraction of the Kaptain SDK is a `Model` class that encapsulates all the configuration and high-level APIs required for the model training, tuning, and serving. Prior to creating an instance of the `Model` class, let's consider an example where we need to specify additional dependecies required for model training, tuning and serving, and also provide minimal required configuration for the model server.

Model dependencies can be provided via pip `requirements.txt`. For example:


```python
%%writefile requirements.txt
scikit-learn>0.24.2
```

Below is an example of the minimally required serving configuration for a scikit-learn model. To learn more about advanced configuration options, consult the Kaptain SDK documentation.


```python
serving_config = {
    "requirements_file": "requirements.txt",  # the model dependenies file. You can provide a different file for serving-specific dependencies
}
```

Finally, a `Model` instance requires providing a base Docker image (`base_image`) to use for model training, a target Docker repository and image name (`image_name`) to publish trainer code to (packed in a Docker image too), and a list of additional files that are required for the model code or the trainer code (`extra_files`).


```python
base_image = "mesosphere/kubeflow:2.0.0-base"
image_name = "mesosphere/kubeflow:mnist-sklearn-sdk"

# name of the file with additional python packages to install into the model image (e.g. "requirements.txt")
requirements = "requirements.txt"
```


```python
import os

from kaptain import envs
from kaptain.model.models import Model
from kaptain.model.frameworks import ModelFramework

envs.VERBOSE = True
envs.DEBUG = True

model = Model(
    id="dev/mnist",
    name="MNIST",
    description="MSNIT Model",
    version="0.0.1",
    framework=ModelFramework.SKLEARN,
    framework_version="0.24.2",
    main_file="training.py",
    image_name=image_name,
    base_image=base_image,
    serving_config=serving_config,
    requirements=requirements,
)
```

The `id` is a unique identifier of the model.
The identifier shown indicates it is an MNIST model in development.

The fields `member` and `description` are for humans: to inform your colleagues and yourself of what the model is about.
`version` is the models' own version, so it is easy to identify models by their iteration.
The `framework` and `framework_version` are for the time being human-friendly metadata.

Since a Docker image is built in the background when you `train` or `tune` a `Model` instance, a `base_image` has to be provided.
The name of the final image `image_name` must be provided with or without image tag.
If the tag is omitted, a concatenation of model `id`, `framework`, and `framework_version` is used.

The `main_file` specifies the name of file that contains the model code, that is, `trainer.py` for the purposes of this tutorial.

To specify additional Python packages required for training or serving, provide the path to your requirements file via the `requirements` parameter of the `Model` class. Details on the format of the requirements file can be found in the [pip official documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirements-file-format).

More details are available with `?Model`.

## Train/tune the model

Training the model is as easy as the following function call:


```python
memory = "1G"
cpu = "0.5"
```


```python
model.train(cpu=cpu, memory=memory, hyperparameters={})
```

The default `gpus` argument is 0, but it is shown here as an explicit option.
Use `?Model.train` to see all supported arguments.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>When resource quotas are set for a namespace, users have to specify <code>cpu</code> and <code>memory</code> explicitly in the SDK. 
Otherwise, tasks such as training and tuning will fail with <code>Error creating: pods ... is forbidden: failed quota: kf-resource-quota: must specify cpu,memory</code>.
These fields are optional when resource quotas are not set.
In case the issue appears for other types of workloads, it is recommended to configure defaults for the user namespace using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/">Limit Range</a>.
</p>

The low accuracy of the model is to make the demonstration of distributed training quicker, as in the next section the model's hyperparameters are optimized anyway.

## Run an experiment


```python
trials = 12
parallel_trials = 2
```


```python
from kaptain.hyperparameter.domains import Double, Discrete

hyperparams = {"--gamma": Double(0.0001, 0.001), "--c": Double(0.01, 1.00)}

model.tune(
    trials=trials,
    parallel_trials=parallel_trials,
    cpu=cpu,
    memory=memory,
    hyperparameters=hyperparams,
    objectives=["accuracy"],
    objective_goal=0.99,
)

## Deploy the Model

Model is ready to be deployed. A trained model can be deployed as an auto-scalable inference service with a single call. When providing additional serving dependencies, make sure to specify sufficient resources (mostly memory) in order for the server to install them without issues.

In this tutorial, we will be using [V2 protocol](https://kserve.github.io/website/modelserving/inference_api/#predict-protocol-version-2) for sklearn predictor. 


```python
serving_config = {"protocol_version": "v2"}

model.serving_config = serving_config
model.deploy(cpu="0.5", memory="500M", replace=True)
```

            "name": "predict",
            "shape": [1, 64],
            "datatype": "FP32",
            "data": data[image_index],
        }

    {
        "model_name": "dev-mnist",
        "model_version": null,
        "id": "ce4bc183-4f26-4fed-9894-8beb0cf153e4",
        "parameters": null,
        "outputs": [
            {
                "name": "predict",
                "shape": [
                    1
                ],
                "datatype": "FP32",
                "parameters": null,
                "data": [
                    7
                ]
            }
        ]
    }


We can see that the class with label "7" has the largest probability; the neural network correctly predicts the image to be a number 7.
