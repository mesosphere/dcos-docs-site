Kaptain SDK Troubleshooting Guide

## Kubernetes resources created by Kaptain SDK
This section covers the resources created by the Kaptain Python SDK when [building](#building), [training](#training),
[tuning](#hyperparameter-tuning), and [serving](#serving).

### Building
The following are the Kubernetes resources created on the building model's Docker image are:
- `Secret` with Docker credentials for Docker registry authorization.
- `Secret` with S3/Minio credentials.
- `Secret` with a Docker registry certificate for secure communications with a Docker registry.
- `job.batch` builds the image with a model training code and dependencies.

All the resources listed above are removed upon successful build completion or notebook cell interruption.

### Training
The following are the Kubernetes resources created on model training:
- Resources created by the [build](#building) step if image rebuilding is needed.
- Either a `tfjob.kubeflow.org` or `pytorchjob.kubeflow.org` for running a distributed training.

By default, training jobs are not removed after completion for troubleshooting purposes, unless the `force_cleanup` parameter of the `Model.train()` method or the `KAPTAIN_SDK_FORCE_CLEANUP` environment variable is set to `True`.
All the resources listed above are removed upon notebook cell interruption.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
The following are the Kubernetes resources created on model tuning:
- Resources created by the [build](#building) step if image rebuilding is needed.
- `experiment.kubeflow.org` for orchestrating the tuning of either `tfjobs.kubeflow.org` or `pytorchjobs.kubeflow.org`.

If the `delete_experiment` flag is set to `True` in the `Model.tune()` function, the `experiment.kubeflow.org` will be cleaned up on successful completion of the tuning step. All the created resources listed above are removed upon notebook cell interruption.


### Serving
The serving machine learning models is implemented by [KFServing](https://github.com/kserve/kserve), which is the component responsible for model serving over HTTP(s) and relies on Knative Serving. When a model is deployed to serving, KFServing creates a set of Knative resources such as Service, Route, and Revision.
One Knative Service is always available per model deployment. However, the number of Revisions can grow with time because every new deployment, for example a new model version with a new image name, has its Revision. When a new Revision is deployed, the older one scales the associated deployment to zero replicas and keeps it.

The following are the Kubernetes resources created on model deployment:
- `Secret` with S3/Minio credentials to access MinIO bucket with a stored model.
- Knative resources: `service.serving.knative.dev`, `route.serving.knative.dev` and `revision.serving.knative.dev`.
- Inference service `serving.kubeflow.org/InferenceService`.

The `Secret` with S3/Minio credentials will be removed on successful completion or cell interruption.
All created the resources listed above are removed upon notebook cell interruption.
