Kaptain is a cloud-native suite of best-of-breed open-source technologies that allow data scientists to extract value from data immediately by providing a familiar environment for development and all the technologies needed to deploy and scale models in production. Kaptain solves a key problem that enterprises face: How to get a return from your expensive AI investments? Promoting from prototype to production is often hard, but it does not have to be in this case, with Kaptain.

D2iQ's Kaptain leverages our expertise in Kubernetes, so that companies can run their machine learning workloads anywhere: in the cloud, on-premise, or in hybrid environments.
Kaptain is an opinionated distribution based on Kubeflow: everything you need to train, deploy, and scale models is packaged and tested, so you can rest assured that it works out of the box.
