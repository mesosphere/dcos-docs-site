When the model is trained, all the model files are packed into a Docker
image, which is then used for the training itself, and for hyperparameter
tuning later on. In order to build that image, the SDK must be provided
with Docker credentials, so that it can publish the resulting images
to the registry specified in `Model.image` attribute.

As the image building happens on the cluster, the model files are first
uploaded to a blob storage such as S3, GCS, or MinIO and then used by
the builder. By default, the SDK uses a cluster-local MinIO installation
which doesn't require any additional configuration. If users wish to
use a specific S3 location instead, then appropriate AWS credentials need
to be provided.

This guide focuses on two main aspects of credential distribution and
configuration:
* Secure automatic mounting of credential files and environment variables to notebook containers
* Using the SDK API for creating and modifying access credentials and parameters.

# Secure mounting of credentials

The standard way of secure sharing of sensitive information in
Kubernetes is by using `Secret` objects. More information about `Secret` objects
is available in the [official Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).
A `Secret` can be created from a file and can be accessed only by the
service account which created it, and by users with administrative
privileges.

After a `Secret` is created it can be mounted to a Notebook container as a file
or used to populate environment variables. To simplify the process, you can create all
the necessary secrets once and then reuse them across notebooks. To make
`Secrets` automatically available for mounting, create a `PodDefault` for them.
For more information about `PodDefault` follow the
[Kubeflow Notebook Setup Guide][kubeflow_setup] or check the
[PodDefault manifest][poddefault_ manifest].

## Docker credentials

In order to make Docker credentials available as a `Secret`,
create a `config.json` file which has the following standard layout:

    {
        "auths": {
                "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
                        "auth": "<username and password in base64>"
                }
        }
    }

The `auth` field is a base64-encoded string of the form
`<username>:<password>` where `<username>` and `<password>` are the
actual username and password used to login to the Docker registry. To
generate the value for `auth` field, use the following command:
`echo -n "<username>:<password>" | base64`.

<p class="message--note">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
It is important that the file with Docker credentials is named <code>config.json</code>
because it is the default name used and recognized by a variety of tools and components.
</p>


To create a `Secret` from the credentials file `config.json` run the
following command:

    kubectl create secret generic docker-secret -n <kaptain_namespace> --from-file=config.json

  Be sure to replace <kaptain_namespace> with the namespace you use for creating notebooks.
  In this example, we used a namespace named 'user'

Verify the `Secret` is created:

    kubectl get secret docker-secret -n <kaptain_namespace> -o yaml

the output should look like this:

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      config.json: ewogICJhdXRocyI6IH...
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: docker-secret
      namespace: user
    type: Opaque

To make this `Secret` available for selection in the Notebook creation
dialogue, create a file named `pod_default.yaml` with the following contents:

    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1alpha1"
    kind: PodDefault
    metadata:
      name: docker-config
      namespace: user
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          docker-config: "true"
      desc: "Add Docker registry credentials"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: docker-secret-volume
          mountPath: /home/kubeflow/.docker/
      volumes:
        - name: docker-secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: docker-secret

<p class="message--warning">
<strong>WARNING: </strong>
The volume name and <code>mountPath</code> must be unique across all <code>PodDefault</code>
objects to avoid conflicts when mounting <code>Secrets</code> to <code>Pods</code>.
</p>

Create the `PodDefault` resource from the file using the following command:

    kubectl create -f pod_default.yaml

After that, the Docker credentials secret will be available for
selection in the Notebook Spawner UI and, if selected, will be mounted
to `/home/kubeflow/.docker/`:

## AWS credentials

### File-based and environment variable based configuration

There are two ways to make AWS credentials available in a notebook:
* As a configuration file mounted to the `Pod` from a `Secret`
* As environment variables injected into the `Pod` from a `Secret`

<p class="message--note">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
Which method to use depends on what AWS settings you need to configure:
<ul>
<li>The configuration file method is recommended when working with the default account settings, i.e. when only credentials
    such as AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, and AWS Session Token are needed to access associated S3
    storage.</li>
<li>The environment variables method is recommended when additional configuration is required, such as AWS Region, S3 Endpoint
    URL, S3 Bucket Access style (url or path-style), and Protocol Signature version. These additional properties are often required
    when working with non-standard S3-compatible storage solutions such as MinIO.</li>
</ul>
</p>

### File-based AWS credentials

Making an AWS credentials file available as a `Secret` follows the same steps as with Docker credentials.
First, create an AWS `credentials` file with the standard layout:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id     = <your AWS Access Key ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your AWS Secret Access Key>
    # optional
    aws_session_token     = <your AWS Session Token>

<p class="message--note">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
It is important that the file with AWS credentials is named <code>credentials</code> because it is the default name used and
recognized by AWS-related tools and components.
</p>

To create a `Secret` from the file `credentials` run the following
command:

    kubectl create secret generic aws-credentials -n <kaptain_namespace> --from-file=credentials

Be sure to replace <kaptain_namespace> with the namespace you use for creating notebooks. In this example, we used a namespace named 'user'

Verify that the `Secret` is created:

    kubectl get secret aws-credentials -o yaml

the output should look like this:

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      credentials: W2RlZmF1bHRdCmF3c19hY2...
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: aws-credentials
      namespace: user
    type: Opaque

To make this `Secret` available for selection in the Notebook creation
dialogue, create a `PodDefault` referencing it. Create a file named
`pod_default.yaml` with the following contents:

    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1alpha1"
    kind: PodDefault
    metadata:
      name: aws-credentials
      namespace: user
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          docker-config: "true"
      desc: "Add AWS credentials"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: aws-secret-volume
          mountPath: /home/kubeflow/.aws/
      volumes:
        - name: aws-secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: aws-credentials

<p class="message--warning">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
Volume name and <code>mountPath</code> must be unique across all <code>PodDefault</code> objects to avoid conflicts when
mounting <code>Secrets</code> to <code>Pods</code>.
</p>

Create a `PodDefault` resource from the file using the following command:

    kubectl create -f pod_default.yaml

After creating this resource, the AWS credentials secret will be available for selection in
the Notebook Spawner UI and, if selected, will be mounted to
`/home/kubeflow/.aws/credentials`:

![image](img/aws_credentials_secret.png)

### Environment variable based AWS configuration

Making AWS configuration and credentials available as environment
variables requires creating a `Secret` from manifest.
The following environment variables are supported and recognized by the SDK:

-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - The access key to authenticate with S3.
-   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - The secret key to authenticate with S3.
-   `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` - The session token to authenticate with S3.
-   `AWS_REGION` - The name of AWS region.
-   `S3_ENDPOINT` - The complete URL of S3 endpoint. This parameter is
    required when working with non-standard, S3-compatible storage
    solutions such as MinIO. It should be set to the resolvable address of
    the running server.
-   `S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION` - The signature version when signing requests
-   `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` - When enabled, clients will use path
    style instead of URL style for accessing buckets. Supported values:
    `true`\|`false`.

Creating a `Secret` with environment variables requires a YAML
specification file (e.g. `secret.yaml`) with the following contents:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: aws-configuration
    data:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <base64-encoded value>
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <base64-encoded value>
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: <base64-encoded value>
      AWS_REGION: <base64-encoded value>
      S3_ENDPOINT: <base64-encoded value>
      S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION: <base64-encoded value>
      S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: <base64-encoded value>
    type: Opaque

`<base64-encoded value>` should contain the actual property value
encoded in base64. To encode a specific value in base64 use the
following command:
`echo -n "<AWS configuration property value>" | base64`.

To create a `Secret` from the YAML specification file (e.g.
`secret.yaml`) run the following command:

    kubectl create -f -n <kaptain_namespace> secret.yaml

Be sure to replace <kaptain_namespace> with the namespace you use for creating notebooks.
In this example, we used a namespace named 'user'.

Verify the `Secret` is created:

    kubectl get secret aws-configuration -o yaml

    # the output should look like this:

    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: QVdTX0FDQ0VTU19LRVlfSUQK
      AWS_REGION: QVdTX1JFR0lPTgo=
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: QVdTX1NFQ1JFVF9BQ0NFU1NfS0VZCg==
      AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: QVdTX1NFU1NJT05fVE9LRU4K
      S3_ENDPOINT: UzNfRU5EUE9JTlQK
      S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE: dHJ1ZQo=
      S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION: UzNfU0lHTkFUVVJFX1ZFUlNJT04K
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: aws-configuration
      namespace: user
    type: Opaque

To make this `Secret` available for selection in the Notebook creation dialogue, create a `PodDefault` referencing it. Create the file `pod_default.yaml` with the following contents:

    apiVersion: "kubeflow.org/v1alpha1"
    kind: PodDefault
    metadata:
      name: aws-configuration
      namespace: user
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          aws-configuration: "true"
      desc: "Add AWS Environment variables"
      envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: aws-configuration

Create a `PodDefault` resource from file using the following command:

    kubectl create -f pod_default.yaml

After that, the AWS configuration secret will be available for selection in
the Notebook Spawner UI and, if selected, will make all the environment
variables available in the Notebook:

# SDK API for Configuring access to Docker and cloud storage

The `Model` class serves as the main API for training, tuning, and
deploying model to serving. It uses a Docker registry for publishing
images with model files and also requires S3-compatible storage for
storing trained models and transient data. For configuring access to
the Docker registry and storage, `Model` exposes a `config` argument which
allows users to fine-tune their configurations. This section covers the available configuration providers and their defaults.

<p class="message--note">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
If no <code>Config</code> is provided, the <code>Model</code> constructor will use Docker credentials from the file
<code>$HOME/.docker/config.json</code>, and the in-cluster MinIO server configuration for storage. A Docker
<code>config.json</code> is mandatory for <code>Model</code> instantiation.
</p>

`Config.default()` in the example below is initialized and expects a
Docker configuration file to be present at
`/home/kubeflow/.docker/config.json` when run from the Notebook:

    model = Model(
        id="Model id",
        name="Model name",
        description="Model description",
        version="Model version",
        framework="tensorflow",
        framework_version="2.3.0",
        main_file="train.py",
        config=Config.default(),
    )

Users can customize the `Config` to provide custom Docker and storage
configuration for example:

    config = Config(
        docker_config_provider=<instance of ConfigurationProvider>,
        storage_config_provider=<instance of ConfigurationProvider>,
    )

The SDK comes with the convenience implementations for Docker and
S3-compatible storage configuration providers.

## Docker Configuration

`DockerConfigurationProvider` supports Docker credentials reading from
a file only.

`DockerConfigurationProvider.default()` loads a configuration from
`/home/kubeflow/.docker/config.json` and fails with an error if the file is not present.

`DockerConfigurationProvider.from_file(<path/to/config.json>)` loads a
configuration from the specified path, and can be used when the config
`Secret` is mounted to a non-default path or created by the user.

Example:

    # building global Config object using custom location of configuration file
    docker_config=DockerConfigurationProvider.from_file("config.json")

    config = Config(
      docker_config_provider=docker_config,
      storage_config_provider=S3ConfigurationProvider.default(),
    )

    # use the created config with the Model
    model = Model(
      id="Model id",
      name="Model name",
      description="Model description",
      version="Model version",
      framework="tensorflow",
      framework_version="2.3.0",
      main_file="train.py",
      config=config,
    )

## AWS Configuration

`S3ConfigurationProvider` supports reading Docker credentials only from a file.

`S3ConfigurationProvider.default()` loads configuration from
`/home/kubeflow/.aws/credentials` and fails with an error if the file is not
present.

`S3ConfigurationProvider.from_file(<path/to/aws/credentials>)` loads
configuration from the specified path and can be used when the config
`Secret` is mounted to a non-default path or created by the user.

`S3ConfigurationProvider.from_env()` loads configuration from the
environment variables and can be used when the configuration `Secret` is
mounted as environment variables or environment variables are set by the
user.

Example:

```python
# building global Config object using environment variables
storage_config=S3ConfigurationProvider.from_env()

config = Config(
  docker_config_provider=DockerConfigurationProvider.default(),
  storage_config_provider=storage_config,
)

# use the created config with the Model
model = Model(
  id="Model id",
  name="Model name",
  description="Model description",
  version="Model version",
  framework="tensorflow",
  framework_version="2.3.0",
  main_file="train.py",
  config=config,
)
```


## MinIO Configuration

`DefaultMinioConfigurationProvider` is a special configuration provider
pre-configured for an in-cluster MinIO instance.

`DefaultMinioConfigurationProvider.default()` returns a configured
instance ready to be used with it. It is used by default when no S3
provider is specified. `DefaultMinioConfigurationProvider` extends
`S3ConfigurationProvider` and supports all the same methods.

Example:

    # building global Config object using MinIO for storage
    storage_config=DefaultMinioConfigurationProvider.default()

    config = Config(
      docker_config_provider=DockerConfigurationProvider.default(),
      storage_config_provider=storage_config,
    )

    # use the created config with the Model
    model = Model(
      id="Model id",
      name="Model name",
      description="Model description",
      version="Model version",
      framework="tensorflow",
      framework_version="2.3.0",
      main_file="train.py",
      config=config,
    )

<p class="message--note">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>
The above example is the default behavior of the SDK for <code>Config</code>
instantiation when no config is provided to the <code>Model</code> constructor.
