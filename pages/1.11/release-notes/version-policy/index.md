excerpt: Understanding DC/OS versioning and releases
---
The format of Mesosphere DC/OS version number is: <code>&lt;Release&gt;.&lt;Version&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;</code>.

# Release numbering

## Release

Modifications or enhancements to the same software product as designated by a change in the <code>R</code> release number.  An <code>R</code> release may include new changes and breaking changes. <code>R</code> Releases do not include separate or different products marketed by Mesosphere under a different name even if such products are compatible with the relevant software product.

## Version

Modifications or enhancements to the same software product as designated by a change in the <code>V</code> release number. <code>V</code> releases will continue to provide backward compatibility to all released APIs.

## Minor

Bug fixes and new enhancements to the same software product as designated by a change in the patch release number.

For example, version 5.6.3, means <code>R</code> is 5, <code>V</code> is 6, and <code>M</code> is 3.

# Mesosphere Software End of Life Policy

Mesosphere will support product releases for the currently released version (Release N) and the previous 2 feature (major or minor release) releases (Releases N-1 and N-2). At the time of Release N-1, Mesosphere will announce End of Life (EOL) date of Release N-2. When Release N is generally available, Mesosphere will EOL Release N-2.

Here is a hypothetical example to help you understand which version is the supported version.

<ol>
<li>May 2020 - Product X v1.0 is released.</li>
<li>Aug 2020 - Product X v1.1 is released, v1.0 EOL date is announced.</li>
<li>Nov 2020 - Product X v1.2 is released,  v1.0 is EOLâ€™d, v1.1 EOL date is announced.</li>
</ol>

# DC/OS Versions and Mesos Interoperability Matrix

All versions of DC/OS come bundled with a compatible Mesos version and its release number will be noted in the appropriate DC/OS Release Version release notes.

# DC/OS Versions and Service Scheduler Interoperability Matrix

All Mesosphere-driven Service Frameworks and their attached baseline technology will be tested to interoperate with the current DC/OS and the previous DC/OS release. Similarly, every release of DC/OS will support the current available (GA) software that the service scheduler leverages and its previous release.  If a DC/OS release supports an older version of the service scheduler, the older service scheduler may not support all of the features provided by the newer version of DC/OS.

For example, if we have 3 pieces of technology: DC/OS, Framework, and Apache Kafka.

Our interoperability guarantees in the scenario above will be as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th><strong>DC/OS Release</strong></th>
  <th><strong>Current DC/OS Release N</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Framework and Baseline Tech (eg. Apache Kafka )</td>
  <td>Current Framework Version (M+Apache Kafka K) and (M-1+Apache Kafka K-1)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
