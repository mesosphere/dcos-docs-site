These metrics are automatically collected by DC/OS.

#  Node

| Metric            | Description                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| cpu.cores         |    Percentage of cores used.     |
| cpu.idle         |     Percentage of CPUs idle.         |
| cpu.system         |    Percentage of system used.   |
| cpu.total         |   Percentage of CPUs used.  |
| cpu.user         |   Percentage of CPU used by the user.   |
| cpu.wait         |   Percentage idle while waiting for an operation to complete.    |
| load.1min         |     Load average for the past minute.       |
| load.5min         |   Load average for the past 5 minutes.        |
| load.15min         |    Load average for the past 15 minutes.        |
| memory.buffers         |   Number of memory buffers.     |
| memory.cached         |   Amount of cached memory.   |
| memory.free         |    Amount of free memory in bytes.   |
| memory.total         |   Total memory in bytes.   |
| process.count         |  Number of processes that are running.          |
| swap.free         |  Amount of free swap space.   |
| swap.total         |  Total swap space.    |
| swap.used         |    Amount of swap space used.    |
| system.uptime          |   The system reliability and load average.    |

### Filesystem metrics

| Metric            | Description                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| filesystem.capacity.free    | Amount of available capacity in bytes. |
| filesystem.capacity.total    | Total capacity in bytes. |
| filesystem.capacity.used    |  Capacity used in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.free    | Amount of available inodes in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.total    | Total inodes in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.used    | Inodes used in bytes.  |

**Note:** The tag `path` is automatically populated based on the mount path of the local filesystem (e.g., `/`, `/boot`, etc).

### Network interface metrics

| Metric            | Description                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| network.in.bytes    | Number of bytes downloaded. |
| network.in.dropped    | Number of downloaded bytes dropped. |
| network.in.errors    | Number of downloaded bytes in error. |
| network.in.packets    | Number of packets downloaded. |
| network.out.bytes    | Number of bytes uploaded. |
| network.out.dropped    | Number of uploaded bytes dropped. |
| network.out.errors    | Number of uploaded bytes in error.  |
| network.out.packets    | Number of packets uploaded. |

**Note:** The tag `interface` is automatically populated based on the type of the network interface (e.g., `spartan`, `d-dcos`, `minuteman`, etc).

# Container

The following per-container resource utilization metrics are collected.

| cpus.limit    | The number of CPU shares allocated. |
| cpus.system.time    | Total CPU time spent in kernel mode in seconds. |
| cpus.throttled.time    | Total time, in seconds, that CPU was throttled. |
| cpus.user.time    | Total CPU time spent in user mode. |

### Disk metrics
