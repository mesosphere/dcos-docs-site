[Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) launches Docker containers from Docker images. Use the Docker Engine if you need [features](/1.11/deploying-services/containerizers/#container-runtime-features) of the Docker Engine. Otherwise, consider using the [Universal Container Runtime](/1.11/deploying-services/containerizers/ucr).

# Provision a container with the Docker Engine

**Important:**
* The default entry point is the launch command for the container. If the entry point accepts arguments, you can specify them in the `args` field of the Marathon app definition. If there is no default entry point, you must specify a command in the `cmd` field. It is invalid to supply both `cmd` and `args` for the same app.
* When you run a Docker image in the Docker Engine, the underlying Docker log files are not truncated or rotated. These files can become arbitrarily large (and often go to a system disk rather than a storage disk). This can cause a server with limited disk space to run out of disk space. Mesosphere recommends that you disable Docker logging if you are using Docker Engine. To do this, set the `log-driver` parameter to `none` in the `containers.docker.parameters` field of your app definition. If you are provisioning the container using the DC/OS web interface:
  1. Click the **JSON EDITOR** toggle.

     ![json editor](/1.11/img/json-editor-toggle.png)

  1. Enter the `parameters` field in the JSON configuration.


## Provision a container with the Docker Engine from the DC/OS web interface

1. Click the **Services** tab of the DC/OS web interface, then click **RUN A SERVICE**.

1. Click **Single Container**.

1. Enter the service ID.

1. In the **CONTAINER IMAGE** field, enter a container image.

1. Click **MORE SETTINGS**. In the **Container Runtime** section, choose the **DOCKER ENGINE** radio button.

1. Click **REVIEW & RUN** and **RUN SERVICE**.

## Provision a container with the Docker Engine from the DC/OS CLI

In your [Marathon application definition](/1.11/deploying-services/creating-services/#deploying-a-simple-docker-based-application-with-the-rest-api), set the `container.type` parameter to `DOCKER`.

```json
{  
   "id":"<my-service>",
   "container":{  
      "type":"DOCKER",
      "docker":{
         "image":"<my-image>",
         "parameters": [
           {
             "key": "log-driver",
             "value": "none"
           }
         ]
      }
   },
   "args":[  
      "<my-arg>"
   ]
}
```
