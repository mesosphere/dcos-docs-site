A Marathon application typically represents a long-running service that has many instances running on multiple hosts. An application instance is called a **task**. The **application definition** describes everything needed to start and maintain the tasks. A Marathon application definition creates a DC/OS **service**.

# Inline shell script
You can deploy a simple program in an inline shell script. Let's start with a simple example: a service that prints `Hello Marathon` to `stdout` and then sleeps for five seconds, in an endless loop.

1. Use the following JSON application definition to describe the application. Create a file with the name of your choice.

    ```json
    {
        "id": "basic-0",
        "cmd": "while [ true ] ; do echo 'Hello Marathon' ; sleep 5 ; done",
        "cpus": 0.1,
        "mem": 10.0,
        "instances": 1
    }
    ```

    In the above example, `cmd` is the command that gets executed. Its value is wrapped by the underlying Mesos executor via `/bin/sh -c ${cmd}`.

1. Use the [DC/OS CLI](/1.11/cli/) to add the service to DC/OS.

    ```bash
    dcos marathon app add <your-service-name>.json
    ```

    When you define and launch a service, Marathon hands over execution to Mesos. Mesos creates a sandbox directory for each task. The sandbox directory is a directory on each agent node that acts as an execution environment and contains relevant log files. The `stderr` and `stdout` streams are also written to the sandbox directory.

## Declaring resources in applications

To run any non-trivial application, you typically depend on a collection of resources: files or archives of files. To manage resource allocation, Marathon has the concept of URIs (uniform resource identifiers). URIs use the [Mesos fetcher](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/fetcher/) to do the legwork in terms of downloading (and potentially) extracting resources.

Example:

```json
{
    "id": "basic-1",
    "cmd": "`chmod u+x cool-script.sh && ./cool-script.sh`",
    "cpus": 0.1,
    "mem": 10.0,
    "instances": 1,
    "fetch": [ { "uri": "https://example.com/app/cool-script.sh" } ]
}
```

The example above executes the contents of `cmd`, downloads the resource `https://example.com/app/cool-script.sh` (via Mesos), and makes it available in the service instance's Mesos sandbox. You can verify that it has been downloaded by visiting the DC/OS web interface and clicking on an instance of `basic-1`, then on the **Files** tab. You should find `cool-script.sh` there.

**Note:** The fetcher does not make dowloaded files executable by default. In the example above, `cmd` first makes the file executable.

As already mentioned, Marathon also knows how to handle application resources that reside in archives. Currently, Marathon (via Mesos and before executing the `cmd`) first attempts to unpack/extract resources with the following file extensions:

* `.tgz`
* `.tar.gz`
* `.tbz2`
* `.tar.bz2`
* `.txz`
* `.tar.xz`
* `.zip`

The following example shows you how this looks in practice. Assume you have an application executable in a zip file at `https://example.com/app.zip`. This zip file contains the script `cool-script.sh` that you want to execute. Here's how:

```json
{
    "id": "basic-2",
    "cmd": "app/cool-script.sh",
    "cpus": 0.1,
    "mem": 10.0,
    "instances": 1,
    "fetch": [ { "uri": "https://example.com/app.zip" } ]
}
```

In contrast to the example `basic-1`, we now have a `cmd` with the value `app/cool-script.sh`. When the zip file gets downloaded and extracted, a directory `app` according to the file name `app.zip` is created and the content of the zip file is extracted into it.

You can specify more than one resource. For example, you could provide a Git repository and some resources from a CDN as follows:

```json
{
    "fetch": [
        { "uri": "https://git.example.com/repo-app.zip", "https://cdn.example.net/my-file.jpg"},
        { "uri": "https://cdn.example.net/my-other-file.css" }
    ]
}
```

A typical pattern in the development and deployment cycle is to have your automated build system place the app binary in a location that's downloadable via an URI. Marathon can download resources from a number of sources. Marathon supports the following [URI schemes](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.1):

* `file:`
* `http:`
* `https:`
* `ftp:`
* `ftps:`
* `hdfs:`
* `s3:`
* `s3a:`
* `s3n:`


# REST API
You can deploy a simple Docker-based application with the REST API. With Marathon it is straightforward to run applications that use Docker images.

In the following example, you deploy a Docker app to DC/OS using the Marathon API. The Docker app is a Python-based web server that uses the [python:3](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/python/) image. Inside the container, the web server runs on port `80` (the value of `containerPort`). `hostPort` is set to `0` so that Marathon assigns a random port on the Mesos agent, which is mapped to port 80 inside the container.

1. Choose whether to use the Universal Container Runtime (UCR) or Docker Engine runtime. See [Using Containerizers](/1.11/deploying-services/containerizers/).
   -  To use the Universal Container Runtime (UCR), paste the following JSON into a file named `basic-3-mesos.json`:

      ```json
      {
        "id": "basic-3-mesos",
        "cmd": "cd /;python3 -m http.server 80",
        "acceptedResourceRoles": ["slave_public"],
        "container": {
          "portMappings": [
            {
              "containerPort": 80,
              "hostPort": 0
            }
          ],
          "type": "MESOS",
          "docker": { "image": "python:3" }
        },
        "cpus": 0.5,
        "mem": 32,
        "networks": [ { "mode": "container/bridge" } ]
      }
      ```

  - To use the Docker Engine runtime, paste the following JSON into a file named `basic-3-docker.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "basic-3-docker",
      "cmd": "cd /;python3 -m http.server 80",
      "acceptedResourceRoles": [ "slave_public" ],
      "container": {
        "portMappings": [
          {
            "containerPort": 80,
            "hostPort": 0
          }
        ],
        "type": "DOCKER",
        "docker": {
          "image": "python:3" },
          "parameters": [
            {
              "key": "log-driver",
              "value": "none"
            }
          ]
      },
      "cpus": 0.5,
      "instances": 1,
      "mem": 32,
      "networks": [ { "mode": "container/bridge" } ]
    }
    ```

1. Use the [Marathon API](/1.11/deploying-services/marathon-api/) to deploy the app `basic-3-docker`. Refer to [Authentication HTTP API Endpoint](/1.11/security/ent/iam-api/) to learn more about the API token required in the command below.

    ```sh
     curl -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)" -X POST <master-IP>/service/marathon/v2/apps -d @basic-3-docker.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
    ```

1. Go to the **Services** tab of the DC/OS GUI to view the running service.
1. Click `basic-3-docker` and then the task ID.
1. Scroll down to the **Marathon Task Configuration** section and note the PORTS property.

1. Determine the [IP address of the public node](/1.11/administering-clusters/locate-public-agent/).
1. Navigate to `<public-node-IP>:<port>` to see the contents of the Docker container's root directory.
