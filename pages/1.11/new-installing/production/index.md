DC/OS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DC/OS build. The Docker container contains all of the bits for DC/OS so it can be used for offline installation.

The DC/OS installation process requires a cluster of nodes to install DC/OS onto and a single node to run the DC/OS installation from.

Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.io> for access to the [DC/OS setup file](https://support.mesosphere.com/hc/en-us/articles/213198586-Mesosphere-Enterprise-DC-OS-Downloads).
