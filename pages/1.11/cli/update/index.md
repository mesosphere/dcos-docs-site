You can update the DC/OS CLI to the latest version or downgrade to an older version.

# <a name="upgrade"></a>Upgrade the CLI

**Important:** If you downloaded the CLI from PyPI or from the DC/OS UI version 1.7 or earlier, you must completely [uninstall](/1.11/cli/uninstall/) the CLI. You cannot upgrade.

You can upgrade an existing DC/OS CLI installation to the latest build.

1.  Remove the current CLI binary. For example, if you installed to `/usr/local/bin/`:

    ```bash
    rm -rf /usr/local/bin/dcos
    ```

1.  Download the DC/OS CLI binary (`dcos`) to your local directory (for example, `/usr/local/bin/`). Update the command with the desired upgrade version (`<version>`):

    ```bash
    curl https://downloads.dcos.io/binaries/cli/darwin/x86-64/dcos-<dcos-version>/dcos
    ```

    **Important:** The CLI must be installed on a system that is external to your DC/OS cluster.

1.  Make the CLI binary executable.

    ```bash
    chmod +x dcos
    ```

    **Tip:** If your system is unable to find the executable, you may need to re-open the command prompt or add the installation directory to your PATH environment variable manually.

1.  Point the CLI to your DC/OS master node. In this example, `http://example.com` is the master node IP address.

    ```bash
    dcos cluster setup http://example.com
    ```

    Follow the instructions in the DC/OS CLI. For more information about security, see the [documentation](/1.11/security/).

    Your CLI should now be authenticated with your cluster! Enter `dcos` to get started.

    ```bash
    dcos

    Get detailed command description with 'dcos <command> --help'.
    ```

# <a name="downgrade"></a>Downgrade the CLI

You can downgrade an existing DC/OS CLI installation to an older version.

1.  Remove the current CLI binary:

    ```bash
    rm path/to/binary/dcos
    ```

1.  From the directory you want to install the new DC/OS CLI binary, enter this command to update the DC/OS CLI with the downgrade version (`<version>`) specified:

    ```bash
    curl https://downloads.dcos.io/binaries/cli/darwin/x86-64/<version>/dcos
    ```
