excerpt: Understanding the DC/OS command line interface

---

The DC/OS command line interface (DC/OS CLI) utility allows you to manage cluster nodes, install and manage packages, inspect the cluster state, and manage services and tasks from a terminal. DC/OS 1.11 requires the DC/OS CLI 0.6.x.

To list available commands, run `dcos` with no parameters:

```bash
dcos

Command line utility for the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS). The Mesosphere DC/OS is a distributed operating system built around Apache Mesos. This utility provides tools for easy management of a DC/OS installation.

Available DC/OS commands:

	auth           	Authenticate to DC/OS cluster
	backup          Back up and restore
	cluster        	Manage connections to DC/OS clusters
	config         	Manage the DC/OS configuration file
	edgelb          Manage load balancing with Edge-LB
	experimental   	Commands under development, subject to change
	help           	Display help information about DC/OS
	job            	Deploy and manage jobs in DC/OS
	license					Use the DC/OS license
	marathon       	Deploy and manage applications to DC/OS
	node           	Administer and manage DC/OS cluster nodes
	package        	Install and manage DC/OS software packages
	security        Manage the DC/OS certificate authority
	service        	Manage DC/OS services
	task           	Manage DC/OS tasks

Get detailed command description with `dcos <command> --help`.

# DC/OS CLI versions and configuration files

DC/OS CLI 0.4.x and 0.5.x use a different structure for the location of configuration files.

DC/OS CLI 0.4.x has a single configuration file, which by default is stored in `~/.dcos/dcos.toml`. In DC/OS CLI 0.4.x you can optionally change the location of the configuration file using the [`DCOS_CONFIG`](#dcos-config) environment variable.

DC/OS CLI 0.5.x has a configuration file for each connected cluster, which by default is stored in `~/.dcos/clusters/<cluster_id>/dcos.toml`. In DC/OS CLI 0.5.x you can optionally change the base portion (`~/.dcos`) of the configuration directory using the [`DCOS_DIR`](#dcos-cdir) environment variable.

**Note:**
- If you update to the DC/OS CLI 0.5.x and run any CLI command, it will trigger conversion from the old to the new configuration structure.
- After you call `dcos cluster setup`, (or after conversion has occurred), if you attempt to update the cluster configuration using a `dcos config set` command, the command displays a warning message saying the command is deprecated and the cluster configuration state may now be corrupted.

# Environment variables

The DC/OS CLI supports the following environment variables, which can be set dynamically.

<a name="dcos-cluster"></a>
#### `DCOS_CLUSTER` (DC/OS CLI 0.5.x and higher only)

The [attached](/1.10/cli/command-reference/dcos-cluster/dcos-cluster-attach/) cluster. To set the attached cluster, set the variable with the command:

```bash
export DCOS_CLUSTER=<cluster_name>
```

<a name="dcos-config"></a>
#### `DCOS_CONFIG` (DC/OS CLI 0.4.x only)

The path to a DC/OS configuration file. If you put the DC/OS configuration file in `/home/jdoe/config/dcos.toml`, set the variable with the command:

```bash
export DCOS_CONFIG=/home/jdoe/config/dcos.toml
```

If you have the `DCOS_CONFIG` environment variable configured:

- After conversion to the [new configuration structure](#configuration-files), `DCOS_CONFIG` is no longer honored.
- Before you call `dcos cluster setup`, you can change the configuration pointed to by `DCOS_CONFIG` using `dcos config set`. This command displays a warning message saying the command is deprecated and recommends using `dcos cluster setup`.


<a name="dcos-dir"></a>
#### `DCOS_DIR` (DC/OS CLI 0.5.x and later only)

The path to a DC/OS configuration directory. If you want the DC/OS configuration directory to be `/home/jdoe/config`, set the variable with the command:

```bash
export DCOS_DIR=/home/jdoe/config
```

1. Optionally set `DCOS_DIR` and run `dcos cluster setup` command.

    ```
    export DCOS_DIR=<path/to/config_dir> (optional, default when not set is ~/.dcos)
    dcos cluster setup <url>
    ```

   This setting generates and updates per cluster configuration under `$DCOS_DIR/clusters/<cluster_id>`. Sets newly set up cluster as the attached one.


<a name="dcos-ssl-verify"></a>
#### `DCOS_SSL_VERIFY`
Indicates whether to verify SSL certificates or set the path to the SSL certificates. You must set this variable manually. Setting this environment variable is equivalent to setting the `dcos config set core.ssl_verify` option in the DC/OS configuration [file](#configuration-files). For example, to indicate that you want to set the path to SSL certificates:

```bash
export DCOS_SSL_VERIFY=false
```

<a name="dcos-log-level"></a>
#### `DCOS_LOG_LEVEL`
Displays log messages to `stderr` at or above the level indicated. This is equivalent to the `--log-level` command-line option. The severity levels are:

*   **debug** Displays all messages to `stderr`, including informational, warning, error, and critical.
*   **info** Displays informational, warning, error, and critical messages to `stderr`.
*   **warning** Displays warning, error, and critical messages to `stderr`.
*   **error** Displays error and critical messages to `stderr`.
*   **critical** Displays only critical messages to `stderr`.

For example, to set the log level to warning:

```bash
export DCOS_LOG_LEVEL=warning
```

<a name="dcos-debug"></a>
#### `DCOS_DEBUG`
Indicates whether to print additional debug messages to `stdout`. By default this is set to `false`. For example:

```bash
export DCOS_DEBUG=true
```
