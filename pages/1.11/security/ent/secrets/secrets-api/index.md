# About the Secrets API

The Secrets API allows you to manage secrets and perform some backend functions such as sealing and unsealing the Secret Store. It offers more functionality than the DC/OS GUI.

# Request and response format

The API supports JSON only. You must include `application/json` as your `Content-Type` in the HTTP header, as shown below.

    Content-Type: application/json


# Host name and base path

The host name to use varies according to where your app is running.

* If your app will run outside of the DC/OS cluster, you should use the cluster URL. To obtain the cluster URL, launch the DC/OS GUI and copy the domain name from the browser. In a production environment, this should be the path to the load balancer that sits in front of your masters.

* If your app will run inside of the cluster, use `master.mesos`.

Append `/secrets/v1/<api_endpoint>` to the host name, as shown below.

    https://<host-name-or-ip>/secrets/v1/<api_endpoint>


# Authentication and authorization

## About authentication and authorization

All Secrets API endpoints require an authentication token.

## Obtaining an authentication token

### Via the IAM API

To get an authentication token, pass the user name and password of a `superuser` in the body of a request to the `/auth/login` endpoint of the [Identity and Access Management Service API](/1.11/security/ent/iam-api/). It returns an authentication token as shown below.

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg"
}
```

### Via the DC/OS CLI

When you log into the [DC/OS CLI](/1.11/cli/) using `dcos auth login`, it stores the authentication token value locally. You can reference this value as a variable in curl commands (discussed in the next section).

Alternatively, you can use the following command to get the authentication token value.

```bash
dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token
```

## Passing an authentication token

### Via the HTTP header

Copy the token value and pass it in the `Authorization` field of the HTTP header, as shown below.

```http
Authorization: token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg
```

### Via curl as a string value

Using curl, for example, you would pass this value as follows.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1aWQiOiJib290c3RyYXB1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNDgyNjE1NDU2fQ.j3_31keWvK15shfh_BII7w_10MgAj4ay700Rub5cfNHyIBrWOXbedxdKYZN6ILW9vLt3t5uCAExOOFWJkYcsI0sVFcM1HSV6oIBvJ6UHAmS9XPqfZoGh0PIqXjE0kg0h0V5jjaeX15hk-LQkp7HXSJ-V7d2dXdF6HZy3GgwFmg0Ayhbz3tf9OWMsXgvy_ikqZEKbmPpYO41VaBXCwWPmnP0PryTtwaNHvCJo90ra85vV85C02NEdRHB7sqe4lKH_rnpz980UCmXdJrpO4eTEV7FsWGlFBuF5GAy7_kbAfi_1vY6b3ufSuwiuOKKunMpas9_NfDe7UysfPVHlAxJJgg"
```

### Via curl as a DC/OS CLI variable

You can then reference this value in your curl commands, as shown below.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token=$(dcos config show core.dcos_acs_token)"
```

## Refreshing the authentication token

Authentication tokens expire after five days by default. If your program needs to run longer than five days, you will need a service account. Please see [Provisioning custom services](/1.11/security/ent/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) for more information.
