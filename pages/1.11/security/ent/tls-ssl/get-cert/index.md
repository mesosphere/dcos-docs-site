To ensure that you are communicating with your DC/OS cluster and not another potentially malicious party, you must obtain the appropriate trust anchor. This trust anchor is part of the DC/OS CA bundle which is a collection of root CA certificates. In the simplest case, it just contains one item: the root CA certificate corresponding to the DC/OS certificate authority. You can obtain the DC/OS CA bundle, using one of these methods:

- [Out of band, recommended](#oob): the only secure way to retrieve the CA bundle is out of band.

- [Via HTTP(S) from Admin Router, insecure](#curl): using curl to retrieve the certificate through insecure HTTP or insecure HTTPS.

# <a name="oob"></a>Retrieving the DC/OS CA bundle out of band

The DC/OS CA bundle is located on any master node at the file system path `/run/dcos/pki/CA/ca-bundle.crt`. For maximum security, you should manually retrieve this file. Alternatively, a reasonably secure method is to SSH into one of the master nodes to obtain the file, if the master nodes cannot be accessed physically.

**Tip:** For simplification and to more easily use the curl commands provided elsewhere in the documentation, you can rename the file from `ca-bundle.crt` to e.g., `dcos-ca.crt`.

# <a name="curl"></a>Using curl to retrieve the DC/OS CA bundle

**Warning:** If you are using `curl` to retrieve the DC/OS CA bundle, you must use the `-k`/`--insecure` flag. If the communication is performed through HTTPS, this flag disables server certificate verification. This allows for a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), where a malicious party in the network path could send a bad CA bundle, causing you to trust entities from outside your DC/OS cluster.

**Prerequisite:** You must have the [DC/OS CLI installed](/1.11/cli/install/) in order to retrieve the cluster URL in the command below.

Use the following command to retrieve the DC/OS CA bundle and save it in the current directory:

```bash
curl -k -v $(dcos config show core.dcos_url)/ca/dcos-ca.crt -o dcos-ca.crt
```
