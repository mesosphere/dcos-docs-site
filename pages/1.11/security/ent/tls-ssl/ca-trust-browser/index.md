# About configuring browsers to trust your DC/OS CA

**Prerequisite:** A local copy of the [root certificate of your DC/OS CA](/1.11/security/ent/tls-ssl/get-cert/).

The procedure for adding your DC/OS CA as a trusted root certificate authority varies by operating system and browser. Refer to the section that corresponds to your browser/operating system pair.

- [Google Chrome on OS X](#osx-chrome)

- [Google Chrome on Windows 10](#win-chrome)

- [Mozilla Firefox on OS X or Windows](#osx-win-firefox)
