Service accounts are used in conjunction with public-private key pairs, secrets, permissions, and authentication tokens to provide access for DC/OS [services](/1.11/overview/concepts/#dcos-service) to DC/OS. Service accounts control the communications and DC/OS API actions that the services are permitted to make.

DC/OS services require authentication depending on your security mode.

| Security mode | Intracluster communication | External cluster communication |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Disabled      | Optional              | Required                   |
| Permissive    | Optional              | Required                   |
| Strict        | Required              | Required                   |

## Service Authentication Components
To authenticate a service, you will need:

-  Public-private key pair
-  Service account
-  Secret for service account
-  Permissions for service account
-  Service login token

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Service authentication involves two JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for service authentication.

-  **Service Login token** To log in to DC/OS, a *service login token* is required. It's a JWT signed with the service's private key and conceptually serves as a one-time password. A service login token should be generated for one-time usage (e.g. for a single service login procedure) and should include an expiration.

-  **Authentication token** After a service connects to DC/OS with the service login token, Bouncer creates an *authentication token* which the service can then use to authenticate its outgoing requests to DC/OS. An authentication token can be used for long-term access.

### Mesos Authentication Principal
DC/OS services supply a principal when they register with the Mesos masters. In [strict security mode](/1.11/security/ent/#security-modes), the service account name must match the name specified in the `principal`. For more information about principals, see the [Mesos documentation](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/authorization/).

The following diagram illustrates this sequence.
