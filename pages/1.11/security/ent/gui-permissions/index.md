By default, a [new user](/1.11/security/ent/users-groups/) has no permissions and cannot view the [DC/OS GUI](/1.11/gui/). You must grant users and groups access to each tab of the GUI.

**Important:** Only [superusers](/1.11/security/ent/perms-reference/#superuser) can view the Dashboard, Nodes, and Cluster -> Overview tabs.
