Users can be granted access to DC/OS by another authorized user. A default user is automatically created by the first user who logs in to the DC/OS cluster. Users can be added from the web interface or from the CLI.

## Add users from the web interface

1.  Launch the DC/OS web interface and log in with your username (Google, GitHub, and Microsoft) and password.

2.  Click on  **Organization** in the left hand menu. From the **Users** screen, click the plus sign (**+**) in the upper right corner, and fill in the new user email address. New users are automatically sent an email notifying them of access to DC/OS.

**Note:** Any user with access to DC/OS can invite more users. Each DC/OS user is an administrator, there is no explicit concept of privileges with DC/OS.

## Add users from the CLI
You can add users to your DC/OS cluster from a terminal by using the `dcos_add_user.py` script. This script is included by default with your DC/OS installation.

**Prerequisites:**

- DC/OS is [installed](/1.11/installing/)

1.  [SSH](/1.11/administering-clusters/sshcluster/) to a master node and run this command, where `<email>` is the user's email:

    ```bash
    sudo -i dcos-shell /opt/mesosphere/bin/dcos_add_user.py <email>
    ```

1.  Send the URL of your DC/OS cluster (e.g. `http://<public-master-ip>/`) to the new user. The user specified by `<email>` can now login and access the cluster.

## Delete users
1.  From the **Users** screen, select the user name and click **Delete**.
2.  Click **Delete** to confirm the action.

## Switching users 

To switch users, you must log out of the current user and then back in as the new user.

### From the web interface

1.   To log out of the DC/OS web interface, click on your username in the upper-left side and select **Sign Out**.

        ![log out](/1.11/img/1-11-user-drop-down-menu.png)

        Figure 3. Drop down user menu

You can now log in as another user.

### From the CLI

1.  To log out of the DC/OS CLI, enter the command:

        ```bash
        dcos config unset core.dcos_acs_token
        Removed [core.dcos_acs_token]
        ```

You can now log in as another user.
