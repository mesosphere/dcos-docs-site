Any of the following methods can be used to install DC/OS:
- [Provision DC/OS manually on AWS](/1.11/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/aws/) (AWS): Install your DC/OS cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the DC/OS templates on AWS CloudFormation. 
- [Provision DC/OS manually on Azure](/1.11/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/azure/): Install your DC/OS cluster on Azure by using the Azure Resource Manager templates.
- [Provision DC/OS on DigitalOcean](/1.11/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/digitalocean/): Install your DC/OS cluster on DigitalOcean by using Terraform templates that are configured to run Mesosphere DC/OS on DigitalOcean.
- [Provision DC/OS on Packet bare metal](/1.11/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/packet/): A bare metal environment is a computer system or network in which a virtual machine is installed directly on hardware rather than within the host operating system (OS). Install your DC/OS cluster on Packet bare metal using Terraform templates that are configured to run Mesosphere DC/OS on Packet.

You can use the [Mesosphere Universal Installer](/1.11/installing/evaluation/) methods to install a fully functional cluster.
