## Authentication

You can opt out of the provided authentication by disabling it for your cluster. To disable authentication, add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`](/1.11/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) file during installation (this requires using the [installation](/1.11/installing/production/deploying-dcos/installation/) method):

```yaml
oauth_enabled: 'false'
```

**Note:** If you have already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in place, you can go through an upgrade with the same [configuration parameter](/1.11/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) set.

## Telemetry

You can opt out of providing anonymous data by disabling telemetry for your cluster. To disable telemetry, you can either:

- Add this parameter to your [`config.yaml`](/1.11/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) file during installation (this requires using the [installation][1] method):

    ```yaml
    telemetry_enabled: 'false'
    ```


**Note:** If you have already installed your cluster and would like to disable this in place, you can go through an upgrade with the same [configuration parameter](/1.11/installing/production/advanced-configuration/configuration-reference/) set.
