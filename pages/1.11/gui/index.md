The DC/OS web interface provides a rich graphical view of your DC/OS cluster.

With the web interface you can view the current state of your entire cluster and DC/OS services. The web interface is installed as a part of your DC/OS installation.

Additionally, there is a User Menu on the upper-left side of the web interface that includes links for [cluster overview](/1.11/gui/cluster), [linked clusters](/1.11/administering-clusters/multiple-clusters/cluster-links), documentation, CLI installation, and user sign out.
