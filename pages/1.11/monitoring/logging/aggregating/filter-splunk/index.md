The file system paths of DC/OS task logs contain information such as the agent ID, framework ID, and executor ID. You can use this information to filter the log output for specific tasks, applications, or agents.

**Prerequisite**

*   [A Splunk installation that aggregates DC/OS logs][1]

# <a name="configuration"></a>Configuration

You can configure Splunk either by using the Splunk [Web UI][2] or by editing the [props.conf file][3].

## <a name="splunkui"></a>Splunk Web UI

1.  Navigate to **Settings** -> **Fields** -> **Field Extractions** -> **New**.
2.  Fill out the form with the following:

    *   Destination app: `search`
    *   Name: `dcos_task` (or any unique, meaningful name for the extraction)
    *   Apply to `source` named `/var/lib/mesos/slave/...`
    *   Type: `Inline`
    *   Extraction/Transform:

        /var/lib/mesos/slave/slaves/(?<agent>[^/]+)/frameworks/(?<framework>[^/]+)/executors/(?<executor>[^/]+)/runs/(?<run>[^/]+)/.* in source

3.  Click **Save**.

4.  In the Field Extractions view, find the extraction you just created and set the permissions appropriately.

The `agent`, `framework`, `executor`, and `run` fields should now be available to use in search queries and appear in the fields associated with Mesos task log events.

## <a name="propsconf"></a>props.conf

1.  Add the following entry to `props.conf` (see the [Splunk documentation][4] for details):

    [source::/var/lib/mesos/slave/...]
    EXTRACT = /var/lib/mesos/slave/slaves/(?<agent>[^/]+)/frameworks/(?<framework>[^/]+)/executors/(?<executor>[^/]+)/runs/(?<run>[^/]+)/.* in source

2.  Run the following search in the Splunk Web UI to ensure the changes take effect:

    extract reload=true

The `agent`, `framework`, `executor`, and `run` fields should now be available to use in search queries and appear in the fields associated with Mesos task log events.

# <a name="usage"></a>Usage example

1. In the Splunk web UI, type `framework=*` into the Search field. This will show all of the events where the `framework` field is defined:

   ![Splunk Framework Exists](/1.11/img/splunk-framework-exists.png)

1. Click the disclosure triangle next to one of these events to view the details. This will show all of the fields extracted from the task log file path:

   ![Splunk Fields](/1.11/img/splunk-fields.png)

1. Search for all of the events that reference the framework ID of the event shown in the screenshot above, but that do not contain the chosen `framework` field. This will show us only non-task results:

   ![Splunk Framework Search](/1.11/img/splunk-framework-search.png)

# <a name="templates"></a>Template examples

Here are example query templates for aggregating the DC/OS logs with Splunk. Replace the template parameters `$executor1`, `$framework2`, and any others with actual values from your cluster.

**Important:** Do not change the quotation marks in these examples or the queries will not work. If you create custom queries, be careful with the placement of quotation marks.

*   Logs related to a specific executor `$executor1`, including logs for tasks run from that executor:

        "$executor1"

*   Non-task logs related to a specific executor `$executor1`:

        "$executor1" AND NOT executor=$executor1

*   Logs (including task logs) for a framework `$framework1`, if `$executor1` and `$executor2` are that framework's executors:

        "$framework1" OR "$executor1" OR "$executor2"

*   Non-task logs for a framework `$framework1`, if `$executor1` and `$executor2` are that framework's executors:

        ("$framework1" OR "$executor1" OR "$executor2") AND NOT (framework=$framework1 OR executor=$executor1 OR executor=$executor2)

*   Logs for a framework `$framework1` on a specific agent host `$agent_host1`:

        host=$agent_host1 AND ("$framework1" OR "$executor1" OR "$executor2")

*   Non-task logs for a framework `$framework1` on a specific agent `$agent1` with host `$agent_host1`:

        host=$agent_host1 AND ("$framework1" OR "$executor1" OR "$executor2") AND NOT agent=$agent
