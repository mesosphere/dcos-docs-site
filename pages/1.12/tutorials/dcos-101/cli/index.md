Welcome to part 1 of the DC/OS 101 Tutorial.

# Prerequisites
To get started with this tutorial, you should have access to a running DC/OS cluster with at least a single master node and 3 agent nodes (of which one is a public agent node). If you don't have these requirements set up, please follow the [setup instructions](//installing/) for various cloud providers, on-premise, or vagrant setups.
If you are unsure which option to choose, then we recommend using the <a href="https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/aws.html" target="_blank">AWS templates</a>. For this tutorial a setup with a single master node is sufficient, but for running production workloads you should have multiple master nodes.

# Objective
You have access to your cluster and have already taken a first look at the GUI. You can also access the cluster from your local machine via the DC/OS CLI. By the end of this section you will have installed the DC/OS CLI and used it to explore your cluster.

# Steps
  * Install the DC/OS CLI
    * Follow the steps [here](//cli/install/) or the `Install CLI` instruction in the lower left corner of the DC/OS GUI.
    * Make sure you are authorized to connect to your cluster by running `dcos auth login`. This is necessary to prevent access from unauthorized people to your cluster.
    * You can also add/invite friends and co-workers to your cluster. See [user management documentation](//security/ent/users-groups/) for details

  * Explore the cluster:
      * Check the running services with `dcos service`. Unless you already installed additional services, there should be two services running on your cluster: Marathon (basically the DC/OS init system) and metronome (basically the DC/OS cron scheduler).
      * Check the connected nodes with `dcos node`. You should be able to see your connected agents nodes (i.e., not the master nodes) in your cluster.
      * Explore the logs of the leading mesos master with `dcos node log --leader`. Mesos is basically the kernel of DC/OS and this tutorial explores the Mesos logs at multiple times during this tutorial.
      * To explore more CLI options, enter the `dcos help` command. There are also help options of the individual commands available e.g., `dcos node --help`. Alternatively, check the [CLI documentation](//cli/).

# Outcome
Congratulations! You have successfully connected to your cluster using the DC/OS CLI, and started exploring some of the CLI commands.
You will make further use of the CLI in the sections that follow.

# Deep Dive
You have already encountered several DC/OS components (including Mesos, Marathon, or Metronome) while experimenting with the DC/OS CLI.
But what other components make up DC/OS?

## DC/OS components
Here are the DC/OS components that are relevant to this tutorial. A full description of all components can be found in the [documentation](//overview/architecture/components/).
* [Marathon](//overview/architecture/components/#marathon) starts and monitors DC/OS applications and services.
* Apache [Mesos](//overview/architecture/components/#apache-mesos) is the kernel of DC/OS and responsible for low-level task maintenance.
* [Mesos DNS](//overview/architecture/components/#mesos-dns) provides service discovery within the cluster.
* [Minuteman](//overview/architecture/components/#minuteman) is the internal layer 4 load balancer.
* [Admin Router](//overview/architecture/components/#admin-router) is an open source NGINX configuration that provides central authentication and proxy to DC/OS services.
* [Universe](//overview/architecture/components/#dcos-package-manager) is the package repository that holds the DC/OS services (e.g. Apache Spark or Apache Cassandra) that you can install on your cluster directly from the DC/OS GUI and CLI.
