# About DC/OS 1.12.0 

DC/OS 1.12.0 includes the following new features and capabilities:

## New Features and Capabilities

### Mesosphere Kubernetes Engine
- High Density Multi-Kubernetes (HDMK) allows operators to take advantage of intelligent resource pooling when running multiple Kubernetes clusters on DC/OS. Compared with other Kubernetes distributions that run a single Kubernetes node per virtual machine, Mesosphere HDMK uses its intelligent resource pooling to pack multiple Kubernetes nodes onto the same server for bare metal, virtual machine, and public cloud instances, driving significant cost savings and resource efficiencies. [Learn more about Kubernetes on DC/OS](/services/kubernetes/2.0.0-1.12.1/).

### Mesosphere Jupyter Service (MJS)
- Delivered secure, [cloud-native Jupyter](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/beta-jupyter/) Notebooks-as-a-Service to empower data scientists to perform analytics and distributed machine learning on elastic GPU-pools with access to big and fast data services.
- Secured connectivity to data lakes and data sets on S3 and (Kerberized) HDFS.
- GPU-enabled Spark and distributed TensorFlow.
- OpenID connect authentication and authorization with support for Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)

### Observability - Metrics
- Introduced a flexible and configurable metrics pipeline with multiple output formats.
- Enhanced support for application metric types including histograms, counters, timers, and gauges.
- Support for sample rates and multi-metrics packets.

## Breaking Changes
- DCOS_OSS-2256 - Removed the DC/OS web installer. 
- DCOS_OSS-3714 - Replaced `dcos-metrics` with Telegraf.
- DCOS_OSS-4243 - By default, Marathon will decline offers for agents in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/changelog.md#maintenance-mode-support-production-ready-now-default). Requests to Marathon's events API (/v2/events when queried directly) for standby instances no longer proxy, but instead responds with a redirect. Clients consuming Marathon's events API should be updated to follow redirects. Component such as updated to versions that follow redirects; for example, Marathon-LB should be updated to at least version v1.12.3. [See more details](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/blob/master/changelog.md#non-leaderstandby-marathon-instances-respond-to-v2events-with-a-redirect-rather-than-proxy).
