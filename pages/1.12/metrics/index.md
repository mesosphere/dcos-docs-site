Metrics in DC/OS, version 1.12 or newer, use [Telegraf](/1.12/overview/architecture/components/#telegraf) to collect and process data. Telegraf provides metrics from DC/OS cluster hosts, containers running on those hosts, and from applications running on DC/OS using the `statsd` process. Telegraf is natively integrated with DC/OS. By default, it exposes metrics in Prometheus format from `port 61091` on each node, and in JSON format through the DC/OS [Metrics API](/1.12/metrics/metrics-api/).

## Overview
DC/OS collects four types of metrics as follows:

* **System:** Metrics about each node in the DC/OS cluster.
* **Component:** Metrics about the components which make up DC/OS.
* **Container:** Metrics about `cgroup` allocations from tasks running in the DC/OS [Universal Container Runtime](/1.12/deploying-services/containerizers/ucr/) or [Docker Engine](/1.12/deploying-services/containerizers/docker-containerizer/) runtime.
* **Application:** Metrics emitted from any application running on the Universal Container Runtime.

Telegraf is included in the DC/OS distribution and runs on every host in the cluster. Because Telegraf provides a plugin-driven architecture, custom DC/OS plugins provide metrics on the performance of DC/OS workloads and DC/OS itself.

Telegraf collects application and custom metrics through the `dcos_statsd` plugin. A dedicated StatsD server is started for each new task. Any metrics received by the StatsD server are tagged with the task name and its service name. The address of the server is provided by environment variables (`STATSD_UDP_HOST` and `STATSD_UDP_PORT`). Note that when a task finishes, any metrics it has emitted that haven't yet been gathered by Telegraf will be discarded. The metrics collected by `dcos_statsd` are gathered every 30 seconds. To ensure a task's metrics are gathered, the task must run for at least 30 seconds.

For more information about the list of metrics that are automatically collected by DC/OS, read [Metrics Reference](/1.12/metrics/reference/) documentation.

## Upgrading from 1.11
DC/OS 1.12 includes an updated `statsd` server implementation for application metrics. The `statsd` update fixes an issue with the `statsd` server implementation in 1.11, which treated all application metrics as gauges, regardless of `statsd` type. 

Dashboards and alerts that rely on counters, histograms, or sets behave differently in 1.12 than in 1.11 as follows:
- Gauges report the last received value. There is no change from 1.11 functionality. 
- Counters report the sum of all received values. In 1.11, counters reported the last received value.
- Histograms and timers report `_sum`, `_min` and `_max` metrics. In 1.11, histograms reported the last received value.
- Sets report the sum of all unique values. In 1.11, sets reported the last received value. 

Additionally, multi-packet metrics and sampling are now available. In 1.11, they were not implemented and resulted in missing metrics. 

## Troubleshooting
Use the following troubleshooting guidelines to resolve errors:

- You can collect metrics about Telegraf's own performance by enabling the `inputs.internal` plugin. 
- You can check the status of the Telegraf `systemd` unit by running `systemctl status dcos-telegraf`. 
- Logs are available from journald via `journalctl -u dcos-telegraf`.
