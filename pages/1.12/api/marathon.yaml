        Change multiple applications either by upgrading existing ones or creating new ones. If there is an update to an already running application, the application gets upgraded. All instances of this application get replaced by the new version. The order of dependencies will be applied correctly. The upgradeStrategy defines the behaviour of the upgrade.

        If the id of the application is not known, the application gets started. The order of dependencies will be applied correctly. It is possible to mix upgrades and installs.

        If you have more complex scenarios with upgrades, use the groups endpoint.

        Change parameters of a deployed application group. The new group parameters get applied.

        * A new application added to the group will be started.

        * An existing application removed from the group will be stopped.


        If there are no changes to the application definition, no restart is triggered. During restart marathon keeps track, that the configured amount of minimal running instances are _always_ available.

        This method allows 2 special modes for the update operation>


        * Provide only the `version` field in the group definition. This will rollback the group to that given version

        * Provide only the `scaleBy` field will scale all transitive applications instance counts by the given factor.


        When one of version or scaleBy are set, nothing else than a version change or transitive instance count scaling will be applied. If both version and scaleBy are set, only a version rollback will be performed. The scaleBy value will not be applied.

        A deployment can run forever. This is the case, when the new application has a problem and does not become healthy. In this case, human interaction is needed with 2 possible choices


        * Rollback to an existing older version

        * Update with a newer version of the group which does not have the problems of the old one.


        Since the deployment of the group can take a considerable amount of time, this endpoint returns immediately with a version. The failure or success of the action is signalled via event. There is a group_change_success and group_change_failed with the given version.

        To use this endpoint, the client has to accept the text/event-stream content type.

        Please note a request to this endpoint will not be closed by the server. If an event happens on the server side, this event will be propagated to the client immediately. See [Server Sent Events](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_serversentevents.asp) for a more detailed explanation.

        Note for ApiConsole&#58; this function will not yield the expected result from inside ApiConsole.

        Abdicating a Marathon instance causes this instance to exit.

        The underlying system is responsible for restarting this instance.


        Every abdication triggers a new leader election.

        The next elected leader will read the state from the persistent store and continue the work from the previous leader.


        It is possible to use this endpoint to trigger a backup or restore operation for the persistent data store.

        The requested operation will be perfomed by the next leading Marathon master.

        changes are requested and the volume of scaling changes out paces the ability to schedule those tasks.

        In addition to the application in the queue, you see also the task count that needs to be started.

        If the task has a rate limit, then a delay to the start gets applied.

        You can see this delay for every application with the seconds to wait before the next launch will be tried.

          List all the tasks queued up or waiting to be scheduled.

          This is mainly used for troubleshooting and occurs when scaling

          changes are requested and the volume of scaling changes out paces the ability to schedule those tasks.

          In addition to the application in the queue, you see also the task count that needs to be started.

          If the task has a rate limit, then a delay to the start gets applied.

          You can see this delay for every application with the seconds to wait before the next launch will be tried.

        If an application fails too often in a specified amount of time (according to the application definition),

        This delay can be removed by calling this endpoint.

        The effect is, that the tasks of this application will be launched immediately.

          Marathon considers all resource offers with roles that have been

          configured by the `--default_accepted_resource_roles` command line flag.

          If no `--default_accepted_resource_roles` was given on startup,

          Marathon considers all resource offers. To register Marathon for a role,

          you need to specify the `--mesos_role` command line flag on startup.

          If you want to assign all resources of a slave to a role,

          you can use the `--default_role` argument when starting up the slave.

          If you need a more fine-grained configuration, you can use the

          `--resources` argument to specify resource shares per role.

      - <code>group.apps.deployments</code> embed all deployment identifier, if the related app currently is in deployment.

      - <code>group.apps.readiness</code> embed all readiness check results

      - <code>group.apps.lastTaskFailure</code> embeds the lastTaskFailure for the application if there is one.

          An order is derived from the dependencies for performing start/stop and

          upgrade of the application. For example, an application /a relies on the

          services /b which itself relies on /c. To start all 3 applications,

          first /c is started than /b than /a.
