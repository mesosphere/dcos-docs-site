The cloud installation method is used to test or demo DC/OS on Azure, AWS, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet. These clusters cannot be upgraded.
DC/OS CloudFormation templates are intended for reference only and are not recommended for production use due to the following limitations:
- CloudFormation does not allow for coordinated zero-downtime in-place updates within Auto Scaling groups.
- CloudFormation does not allow for automated zero-downtime replacement of Auto Scaling groups.
- Replacing DC/OS agent nodes requires manual data migration of local storage volumes for stateful services.
- Updates of DC/OS on AWS CloudFormation have not been automated, validated, or documented.
- Modified CloudFormation templates are not supported by Mesosphere, Inc.

You can use the [Production Installation](/1.12/installing/production/) methods to install a fully functional cluster.
