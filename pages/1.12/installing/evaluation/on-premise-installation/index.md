<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Ensure that your on-premises cluster is protected by appropriate <a href="/1.12/administering-clusters/securing-your-cluster/#network-security">network security</a> mechanisms.</p>

You can install a DC/OS cluster on your own premises using the following methods:

1. [DC/OS installation with Ansible On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/ansible-dcos/blob/master/docs/INSTALL_ONPREM.md).
2. [DC/OS installation with Chef On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-chef).
3. [DC/OS installation with Puppet On-Premises](https://github.com/dcos-labs/dcos-puppet).

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> These installation methods are not officially supported by Mesosphere, but are supported by the DC/OS community. Contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dcos.io/forum/#!forum/users">mailing list</a> or <a href="http://chat.dcos.io/?_ga=2.226911897.58407594.1533244861-1110201164.1520633201">Slack channel</a> for community support. The recommended way to install production-ready DC/OS that can be upgraded in place is to use the <a href="/1.12/installing/production/deploying-dcos/installation/">production installation</a> method.</p>
