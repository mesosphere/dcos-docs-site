<p class="message--warning"><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong>This is a <a href="https://github.com/dcos/terraform-dcos/tree/master/gcp">community driven project</a> and not officially supported by Mesosphere. This installation method is used for fast demos and proofs of concept. Installing DC/OS cluster on AWS, Azure, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet are intended for reference only and are not recommended for production use. Upgrades are not supported with the following installation methods.</p>

The community supported installation methods are used to test or demo DC/OS on AWS, Azure, GCE, Digital Ocean, or Packet. 

Any of the following methods can be used to install DC/OS:
- [Provision DC/OS on Amazon Web Services](/1.12/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/aws/) (AWS): Install your DC/OS cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the DC/OS templates on AWS CloudFormation. 
- [Provision DC/OS on Azure](/1.12/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/azure/): Install your DC/OS cluster on Azure by using the Azure Resource Manager templates.
- [Provision DC/OS on DigitalOcean](/1.12/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/digitalocean/): Install your DC/OS cluster on DigitalOcean by using Terraform templates that are configured to run Mesosphere DC/OS on DigitalOcean.
- [Provision DC/OS on Packet bare metal](/1.12/installing/evaluation/community-supported-methods/packet/): A bare metal environment is a computer system or network in which a virtual machine is installed directly on hardware rather than within the host operating system (OS). Install your DC/OS cluster on Packet bare metal using Terraform templates that are configured to run Mesosphere DC/OS on Packet.

You can use the [Production Installation](/1.12/installing/production/) methods to install a fully functional cluster.
