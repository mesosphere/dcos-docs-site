# Requirements and Recommendations

These directions cover the installation of Docker CE on CentOS/RHEL. Before installing Docker on CentOS/RHEL, review the general [requirements and recommendations for running Docker on DC/OS][1] and the following CentOS/RHEL-specific recommendations:

* OverlayFS is now the default in Docker CE. There is no longer a need to specify or configure the overlay driver. Prefer the OverlayFS storage driver. OverlayFS avoids known issues with `devicemapper` in `loop-lvm` mode and allows containers to use docker-in-docker, if they want.

* These instructions are specific to CentOS/RHEL 7.4. Other versions of CentOS/RHEL 7 should work but might require minor modifications to the commands.

* Format node storage as XFS with the `ftype=1` option. As of CentOS/RHEL 7.2, [only XFS is currently supported for use as a lower layer file system][2].

* For more generic Docker requirements, see [System Requirements: Docker](/1.12/installing/production/system-requirements/#docker).

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong> In modern versions of Centos and RHEL, <code>ftype=1</code> is the default. The <code>xfs_info</code> utility can be used to verify that <code>ftype=1</code>.</p>


    ```bash
    mkfs -t xfs -n ftype=1 /dev/sdc1
    ```

# Installation

Follow the Docker [CentOS-specific installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/).

### RHEL-only requirements

You must register with the subcription-manager to enable additional repos.

Follow the Docker [CentOS-specific installation instructions][3]

### RHEL Only: subcription-manager

1.  Subscribe the RHEL system in subscription-manager and add the repos

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --username <RHEL-SUBSCRIPTION-USERNAME> --password ******** --auto-attach

    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
    ```

# Example: Installing Docker with OverlayFS on CentOS/RedHat

The following instructions demonstrate how to use Docker with OverlayFS on CentOS 7.

1.  Configure OS for overlay storage

    ```bash
    sudo echo 'overlay' >> /etc/modules-load.d/overlay.conf
    sudo modprobe overlay
    ```

1.  Run yum update

    ```bash
    sudo yum update --exclude=docker-engine,docker-engine-selinux,centos-release* --assumeyes --tolerant
    ```

1.  Un-install old versions of Docker (if present):

    ```bash
    sudo yum remove docker \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-selinux \
                  docker-engine
    ```

1.  Set up Docker CE repository:

    ```bash
    sudo yum-config-manager \
        --add-repo \
        https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    ```

1.  Show versions of Docker CE. 

    ```bash
    sudo yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
    ```

The remainder of these instructions assume that you have installed the latest version.

6.  Install Docker CE:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install docker-ce
    ```

1.  Start Docker:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo systemctl enable docker
    ```

1.  Test Docker with `hello-world` app:

    ```bash
    sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

1.  Verify that Docker is using the overlay driver:

    ```bash
    sudo docker info | grep Storage
    ```
