excerpt: Creating an archive for a private Docker registry

enterprise: false
---


To supply credentials to pull from a private Docker registry, create an archive of your Docker credentials, then add it as a URI in your service or pod definition. In DC/OS Enterprise, you can also [upload your private Docker registry credentials to the DC/OS Secret store](#secret-store-instructions) and reference it in your service or pod definition.

# Referencing private Docker registry credentials as a URI

## Step 1: Compress Docker credentials

1. Log in to the private registry manually. Login creates a `.docker` folder and a `.docker/config.json` file in your home directory.

    ```bash
    docker login some.docker.host.com
    Username: foo
    Password:
    Email: foo@bar.com
    ```

1. Compress the `.docker` folder and its contents.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    tar -czf docker.tar.gz .docker
    ```
1. Verify that both files are in the archive.

    ```bash
      tar -tvf ~/docker.tar.gz

      drwx------ root/root         0 2015-07-28 02:54 .docker/
      -rw------- root/root       114 2015-07-28 01:31 .docker/config.json
    ```

1. Put the archive file in a location that is accessible to your application definition.

    ```bash
    cp docker.tar.gz /etc/
    ```


<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> The URI must be accessible by all nodes that will start your application. You can distribute the file to the local filesystem of all nodes, for example via RSYNC/SCP, or store it on a shared network drive like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. Consider the security implications of your chosen approach carefully.</p> 


## Step 2: Add URI path to service definition

1. Add the path to the archive file login credentials to your service definition.

    ```bash
    "fetch": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///etc/docker.tar.gz"
      }
    ]
    ```

    For example:

    ```json
    {  
      "id": "/some/name/or/id",
      "cpus": 1,
      "mem": 1024,
      "instances": 1,
      "container": {
        "type": "DOCKER",
        "docker": {
          "image": "some.docker.host.com/namespace/repo"
        }
      },
      "fetch": [
        {
          "uri": "file:///etc/docker.tar.gz"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    The Docker image will now pull using the provided security credentials.

# Referencing private Docker registry credentials in the secrets store [enterprise type="inline" size="small" /]

Follow these steps to add your Docker registry credentials to the [DC/OS Enterprise secrets store](/security/ent/secrets/), and then reference that secret in your service definition.

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>This functionality is available only with the <a href="//deploying-services/containerizers/ucr/">Universal Container Runtime</a>). If you need to use the Docker Engine, follow the URI instructions above.</p>

## Step 1: Create a credentials file

1.  Manually log in to your private registry. This creates a `~/.docker` directory and a `~/.docker/config.json` file.

    ```bash
    docker login some.docker.host.com
    Username: foo
    Password:
    Email: foo@bar.com
    ```

1.  Check that you have the `~/.docker/config.json` file.

    ```bash
    ls ~/.docker
    config.json
    ```

    Your `config.json` file should look like this, where value of `auth` is a base64-encoded `username:password` string.

    ```json
    {
      "auths": {
          "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
              "auth": "XXXXX",
              "email": "<your-email>"
          }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you are using Mac OS, you will need to manually encode your `username:password` string and modify your `config.json` to match the snippet above. Be sure to omit a trailing new-line when base64 encoding the pair:

    ```bash
    echo -n myuser@domain.com:hard-to-guess-password | base64
    ```

1. Add the `config.json` file to the DC/OS secret store. [Learn more about creating secrets](/1.9/security/ent/secrets/create-secrets/).

   <p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>As of DC/OS version 1.10.0, you can add a file to the secret store only using the DC/OS CLI.</p>

   ```bash
   dcos security secrets create --file=config.json <path/to/secret>
   ```

   If you plan to follow the example below, enter the following command to add the secret:

   ```bash
   dcos security secrets create --file=config.json mesos-docker/pullConfig
   ```

## Step 2: Add the secret to your service or pod definition

### For a service

1. Add a location for the secret in the `secrets` parameter and a reference to the secret in the `docker.pullConfig` parameter.

   <p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>This functionality is <strong>only</strong> supported with the Universal Container Runtime: <code>container.type</code> must be <code>MESOS</code>.</p>

   ```json
   {
      "id": "/mesos-docker",
      "container": {
        "docker": {
          "image": "<your/private/image>",
          "pullConfig": {
            "secret": "pullConfigSecret"
          }
        },
        "type": "MESOS"
      },
      "secrets": {
        "pullConfigSecret": {
          "source": "/mesos-docker/pullConfig"
        }
      },
      "args": ["hello"],
      "cpus": 0.2,
      "mem": 16.0,
      "instances": 1
   }
   ```

1. Add the service to DC/OS. If you are using the example above, `<svc-name>` is `mesos-docker`.

   ```
   dcos marathon app add <svc-name>.json
   ```

   The Docker image will now pull using the provided security credentials.

### For a pod

1. Add a location for the secret in the `secrets` parameter and a reference to the secret in the `containers.image.pullConfig` parameter.

   <p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>This functionality is only supported if <code>image.kind</code> is set to <code>DOCKER</code>.</p>

   ```json
   {
        "id":"/simple-pod",
        "containers":[
           {
             "name":"simpletask1",
             "exec":{
                 "command":{
                   "shell":"env && sleep 1000"
                 }
               },
             "resources":{
               "cpus":0.1,
               "mem":32
           },
           "image":{
               "kind":"DOCKER",
               "id":"<your/private/image>",
               "pullConfig":{
                 "secret":"pullConfigSecret"
              }
           }
        }
     ],
     "networks":[
         {
           "mode":"host"
         }
     ],
     "secrets":{
         "pullConfigSecret":{
           "source":"/pod/pullConfig"
        }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Add the pod to DC/OS. If you are using the example above, `<pod-name>` is `simple-pod`.

      ```
      dcos marathon pod add <pod-name>.json
      ```

   The Docker image will now pull using the provided security credentials.

# Configuring the Docker registry to use a custom certificate
As an alternative to providing user credentials to authorize access to the private Docker registry, you can use a custom certificate to authorize access to the private Docker registry.

To configure a custom certificate for accessing the private Docker registry and DC/OS UCR:

1. Create or identify a custom certificate that you want to use as a trusted certificate for accessing the Docker registry.

    You can use OpenSSL, DC/OS Enterprise CLI, or another program for generating public and private keys, certificate requests, and encrypted client and server certificates.

1. Download or copy the certificate to the appropriate location.

   For example, if you want to configure the DC/OS `ca.crt` certificate as a trusted certificate, you can download a copy of the `ca.crt` file to a local directory and set it as trusted using a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/docker/certs.d/master.mesos:5000/ca.crt /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/docker-registry-ca.crt
    ```

1. Generate a hash for the file by running a command similar to the following:

    ```bash
    cd /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/
    openssl x509 -hash -noout -in docker-registry-ca.crt

1. Create the /pki/tls/certs directory on the public agent for storing trusted certificates.

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /pki/tls/certs
    ```

1. Create a symbolic link from the trusted certificate to the `/pki/tls/certs` directory on the public agent.

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/docker-registry-ca.crt /var/lib/dcos/pki/tls/certs/<hash_number>.0
    ```

# Pushing a custom image to a private registry from a tarball

If you asked your sales representative for an enterprise version of Marathon, you may have been given a Docker image in a `.tar` archive. Follow these steps to deploy it to your registry:

## Step 1: Import in the local machine

1. Load the tarball into your local Docker client, passing the path to your custom tarball. For example, `marathon-dcos-ee.<version>.tar`:
   ```bash
   docker load -i marathon-dcos-ee.<version>.tar
   ```

    **Tip:** You can view the Marathon image with this command.

    ```
    docker images
    ```

    You should see output similar to this:

    ```bash
    REPOSITORY                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    mesosphere/marathon-dcos-ee   1.4.0-RC4_1.9.4     d1ffa68a50c0        3 months ago        926.4 MB
    ```

## Step 2: Push the image to the repository

1. Re-tag the file to match the repository that you are using in your private Docker registry:
   ```bash
   docker tag \
    mesosphere/marathon-dcos-ee:<mesosphere-tag> \
    <your-repo>/marathon-dcos-ee:<your-tag>
   ```

   Where:

   - `<mesosphere-tag>` is the tag of the image from Mesosphere. Typically, this will match the version number in the filename.
   - `<your-repo>` is the name of the private repository that you want to store the image in.
   - `<your-tag>` is the tag for the image. It is recommended that you use the same tag as the Mesosphere image.
1. Push the new image to your private Docker registry:
   ```bash
   docker push <your-repo>/marathon-dcos-ee:<your-tag>
   ```
