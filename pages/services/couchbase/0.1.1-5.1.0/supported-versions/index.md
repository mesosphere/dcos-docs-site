## Package Versioning Scheme

- DC/OS: 1.11

Packages are versioned with an a.b.c-x.y.z format, where a.b.c is the version of the DC/OS integration and x.y.z indicates the version of Couchbase. For example, 0.1.1-5.1.0 indicates version 0.1.1 of the DC/OS integration and version 5.1.0 of Couchbase.

## Version Policy

The DC/OS Couchbase Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of Couchbase.
