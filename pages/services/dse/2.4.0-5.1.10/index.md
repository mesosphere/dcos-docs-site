Â Our customers have been using our technology to build personalization, IoT, Customer 360 type applications, just to name a few.  Inside {{ model.techName }}, you will find Solr to power our search capability, Spark for analytics, and a graph database for highly connected data sets. Multiple {{ model.techShortName }} clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer {{ model.techName }} as a managed service to your organization.
