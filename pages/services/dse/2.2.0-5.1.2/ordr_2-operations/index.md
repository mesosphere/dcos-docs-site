## DSE OpsCenter Backup Service

**Regular backups should be performed via the DSE OpsCenter Backup Service in production environments.  Backups and restores should be tested in a staging environment.**

The [OpsCenter Backup Service](https://docs.datastax.com/en/latest-opscenter/opsc/online_help/services/opscBackupService.html) allows you to create automatic or manual backups of your cluster data, from all the keyspaces in a cluster to specific keyspaces. You can perform both local and remote backups, and restoration ("cloning") to a different cluster. Backup data is stored locally on each node, and optionally in cloud-based storage services like Amazon S3.
