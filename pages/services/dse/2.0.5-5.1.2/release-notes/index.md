## Improvements

- Upgraded to the latest stable release of the dcos-commons SDK.
- Better support for configuring/using DSE Unified Authentication. See the [authentication documentation](/service-docs/dse/2.0.3-5.1.2/dse-authentication).

## Breaking Changes

- New authentication configuration options have been added, and one existing option (`ldap.default_scheme`) has been moved.  Follow the steps in the Upgrade section, below, to prepare your configuration options and perform the upgrade.

## Upgrade Steps

- Upgrade to the latest version of the CLI: `dcos package install --cli datastax-dse --package-version=2.0.3-5.1.2`.

### On DC/OS 1.10 Enterprise:
  1. Save your current configuration: `dcos datastax-dse describe > $HOME/options.json`.
  1. Update your configuration. Add the following options to your `$HOME/options.json` file just before the "ldap" section.

    ```
    "authentication_options_enabled": false,
    "authentication_options_default_scheme": "internal",
    "authentication_options_scheme_permissions": true,
    "authentication_options_allow_digest_with_kerberos": true,
    "authentication_options_plain_text_without_ssl": "warn",
    "authentication_options_transitional_mode": "disabled",
    "role_management_options_mode": "internal",
    "authorization_options_enabled": false,
    "authorization_options_transitional_mode": "disabled",
    "authorization_options_allow_row_level_security": false,
    ```

  1. The location of `ldap.default_scheme` has been changed. Record the current value and then delete that option from the ldap section. The new option is named `authentication_options_default_scheme`. Set this value to the value you just recorded.
  1. Set your authentication and authorization options according to your needs. See the [authentication documentation](/service-docs/dse/2.0.3-5.1.2/dse-authentication).
  1. Save your changes to that file and run the following command: `dcos datastax-dse update start --replace --options=$HOME/options.json --package-version=2.0.3-5.1.2`.
  1. After the service performs a rolling restart of each node, the upgrade is complete.
  
 ### On DC/OS 1.9 and DC/OS Open Source
 
  1. Create an `options.json` file with your existing installation options. If you saved a copy during initial install, you can use that. If you don't have it, follow the steps in the "Recreating options.json" section of the [management docs](/service-docs/dse/2.0.3-5.1.2/managing/#enterprise-dcos-1.10). When you have obtained your `options.json` file, place a copy of it in `$HOME/options.json`.
  1. Update your configuration. Add the following options to your `$HOME/options.json` file just before the "ldap" section.

     ```
     "authentication_options_enabled": false,
     "authentication_options_default_scheme": "internal",
     "authentication_options_scheme_permissions": true,
     "authentication_options_allow_digest_with_kerberos": true,
     "authentication_options_plain_text_without_ssl": "warn",
     "authentication_options_transitional_mode": "disabled",
     "role_management_options_mode": "internal",
     "authorization_options_enabled": false,
     "authorization_options_transitional_mode": "disabled",
     "authorization_options_allow_row_level_security": false,
     ```

  1. The location of ldap.default_scheme has been changed. Record the current value and then delete that option from the ldap section. The new option is named authentication_options_default_scheme. Set this value to the value you just recorded.

  1. Set your authentication and authorization options according to your needs. See the [authentication documentation](/service-docs/dse/2.0.3-5.1.2/dse-authentication).
  1. Save your changes to that file
  1. Get the marathon app id for dse: `marathon app list`.
  1. Remove the app: `marathon app remove <dse-app-id-here>`.
  1. Wait 30 seconds and then confirm the dse app is no longer present: `marathon app list`.
  1. Install the latest version: `dcos package install --options=$HOME/options.json --package-version=2.0.3-5.1.2`.
  1. After the service performs a rolling restart of each node, the upgrade is complete.
  
# Version 2.0.2-5.1.2

## Bug Fixes
* Tasks will correctly bind on DC/OS 1.10.

# Version 2.0.0-5.1.2

## Improvements
- Based on the latest stable release of the dcos-commons SDK, which provides numerous benefits:
  -Integration with DC/OS features such as virtual networking and integration with DC/OS access controls.
  - Orchestrated software and configuration updates, enforcement of version upgrade paths, and ability to pause/resume updates.
  - Placement constraints for pods.  
  - Uniform user experience across a variety of services.
- Upgrade to version 5.1.2 of DataStax Enterprise.
- Upgrade to version 6.1.2 of DataStax Enterprise Opscenter.

## Breaking Changes
- This is a major release available for DC/OS 1.9 or higher. You cannot upgrade to version 2.0.0-5.1.2 from any previous versions of the  package. This is due to the separation of the core DSE nodes from Opscenter.
