## Version 2.6.0-2.2.1

### Updates
- Upgrade the base dcos-commons SDK version to `0.56.1`.
- Upgrade {{ model.techShortName }} base tech to version `2.2.1`. See [{{ model.techShortName }}'s Release Notes](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.2.1/RELEASE_NOTES.html) for details.
- Oracle JDK is replaced by OpenJDK 8 

### New Features

## Version 2.5.0-2.1.0

### Important Notes

* The `inter_broker_protocol_version` now defaults to the newer, `2.1` version. This has a few implications, as described below:

    - Kafka 1.1.0 supports `inter_broker_protocol_version`: `1.1` maximum, and by default it is set to `1.0`.
    - Kafka 2.1.0 supports `inter_broker_protocol_version`s up to `2.1`. 
    - If you haven't specified a `inter_broker_protocol_version` in your options file, the new default will be used and changed to `2.1`.

    The problem with this is that it will cause downtime;  during the upgrade, some Kafka nodes will be on Kafka 1.1.0 using `inter_broker_protocol_version` `1.0` and others will be on Kafka 2.1.0 using protocol `2.1`.

    To avoid any potential downtime, change the protocol version used when upgrading Kafka.

    - Set up CLI to connect to a soak cluster
    - Update your `options_file.json` with the following contents:
        ```
        {
            ...
            "kafka": {
                ...
                "inter_broker_protocol_version": "1.0"
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
        ```

    - And update your service like so:
       ```
       ~$ dcos package install --cli --yes kafka
       ~$ dcos kafka --name=data-services/kafka update start \
           --package-version=2.5.0-2.1.0 \
           --options=options_file.json
       ```

# Version 2.0.0-0.11.0

## Improvements
- Based on the latest stable release of the dcos-commons SDK, which provides numerous benefits:
  - Integration with DC/OS features such as virtual networking and integration with DC/OS access controls.
  - Orchestrated software and configuration update, enforcement of version upgrade paths, and ability to pause/resume updates.
  - Placement constraints for pods.
  - Uniform user experience across a variety of services.
- Graceful shutdown for brokers.
- Update to 0.11.0.0 version of Apache {{ model.techShortName }} (including log and protocol versions).

## Breaking Changes
- This is a major release.  You cannot upgrade to version 2.0.0-0.11.0 from a 1.0.x version of the package. To upgrade, you must perform a fresh install and replicate data across clusters.
