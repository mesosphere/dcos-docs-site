Release notes for Edge-LB.

# v0.1.9

## Noteworthy changes:

- Fix path routing bug which resulted in adding a "/" to paths in certain configurations.
- Fix `dcos edgelb` cli for clusters with dashboard URLs using `http://` scheme.

Shortlist:

```
% git shortlog v0.1.8..HEAD

```

## Known Limitations

* The Edge-LB v0.1.9 CLI requires that all pool definitions are contained within a single YAML or JSON file. Pools cannot be configured independently because of this limitation.
* Edge-LB does not currently support `Disabled` security mode.
* Edge-LB does not currently support `Strict` security mode.
* Edge-LB does not currently support upgrades between versions.
* Edge-LB does not currently support self-service configuration; all configuration must be handled centrally.
* There is no way to create an individual Edge-LB pool without submitting a full Edge-LB configuration.
* The number of instances of load balancers cannot be scaled down.

## Known Issues

* The steps presented in the UI to uninstall Edge-LB are currently incorrect. Follow the steps in the [Edge-LB uninstall documentation](/services/edge-lb/0.1/uninstalling/).
* Edge-LB running on a CentOS/RHEL 7.2 node where /var/lib/mesos is formatted with ext4 may have connection issues.
* If a pool is configured with invalid constraints, that pool will not be properly created and will not respect pool deletion.  It must be removed manually.
