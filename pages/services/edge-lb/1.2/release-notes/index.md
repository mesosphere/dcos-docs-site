These are the release notes for Edge-LB 1.2.

# v1.2.1

Released on September 17, 2018.

## Notable Changes

- Added Add timestamp to log messages produced during cont. start
- Replace manual logline prefixing with proper source code file log field
- Migrate logging to logrus, unify logging
- Increase log retention for edge-lb containers
- Add extra logging about the mesos state snapshot logging for better troubleshooting of Edge-LB

## Known Limitations

* Edge-LB does not currently support `Strict` security mode on DC/OS 1.10, but supports `Strict` security mode in DC/OS 1.11.
* Edge-LB does not currently support self-service configuration; all configuration must be handled centrally.

## Known Issues

* The steps presented in the UI to uninstall Edge-LB are incorrect. Follow the steps in the [Edge-LB uninstall documentation](/services/edge-lb/1.2/uninstalling/).
* Edge-LB running on a CentOS/RHEL 7.2 node where `/var/lib/mesos` is formatted with ext4 may have connection issues.
* If a pool is configured with invalid constraints, that pool will not be properly created and will not respect pool deletion. It must be removed manually.

# v1.2.0

Released on September 11, 2018.

## Notable Changes

* dcos-template: Properly handle nil values for some of the Mesos tasks protobuf fields.
* dcos-template: Set maximum grpc recv. message size to 100MIB.
* lbmgr: Adjust environment passing to match the new haproxy svc launch model. This fixes `AUTOCERT` and `SECRET` env passing in the haproxy task container.
* api-swagger-spec: Bump api version to match edgelb version.
* Introduce proper versioning for edgelb-pool cosmos package to match the version of the package with the version of the edgelb package itself instead of `stub-universe`.
* Make the output of `dcos edgelb show --json` cmd be the actual pool configuration instead of wrapping it in a configuration container. This enables feeding the output of `show` command directly to the `update` command.
* Cleanup of the goswagger code generation code and build chain, bump of goswagger tool used for generation from v0.11 to v0.16.
* Bump `golang` from 1.8.3 to 1.10.3.
* Fix anonymous ACLs logic for predefined conditions.
* Bump `haproxy` from 1.8.12 to 1.8.13. [changelog] (http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-1.8.git;a=blob;f=CHANGELOG;h=aed48fc5fb951aff7dd458c4bc9bfcfe1d5dd99a;hb=HEAD)
* Commit protobuf code changes that stem from [tool update](https://github.com/golang/protobuf/tree/master/protoc-gen-go).
