# Known Limitations

- Edge-LB currently does not support `Strict` security mode on DC/OS 1.10, but supports `Strict` security mode in DC/OS 1.11.
- Edge-LB currently does not support self-service configuration. All configuration must be handled centrally.

# Known Issues

- The steps provided in the DC/OS 1.10 web interface to uninstall Edge-LB are incorrect. In order to correctly uninstall Edge-LB for any given DC/OS version, please follow the steps in the [Edge-LB uninstall documentation](/services/edge-lb/1.3/uninstalling/).
- Edge-LB running on a CentOS/RHEL 7.2 node where `/var/lib/mesos` is formatted with `ext4` may have connection issues.
- If a pool is configured with invalid constraints, that pool will not be properly created and will not respect pool deletion. It must be removed manually.
