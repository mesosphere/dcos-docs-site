HiveMQ is a MQTT broker tailored specifically for enterprises, which find themselves in the emerging age of Machine-to-Machine communication (M2M) and the Internet of Things.

It was built from the ground up with maximum scalability and enterprise-ready security concepts in mind.

HiveMQ implements the MQTT protocol, the de-facto M2M messaging standard, and through its 100% compliance to the specification, it is leading when it comes to professional adoption of all possibilities of the Internet of Things for companies.

As members of the OASIS committee, the HiveMQ team was directly involved in the creation and release of MQTT 5.0, the newest version of the lightweight protocol.

New users are encouraged to use the latest version available. Please choose one on the left and get started!
