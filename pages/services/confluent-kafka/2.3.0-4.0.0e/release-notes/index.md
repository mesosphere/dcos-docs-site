See [Confluent Platform 3.3.1 release notes](https://docs.confluent.io/3.3.1/release-notes.html)

# Version 2.0.2-3.3.0e

## Bug fixes
* Uninstall now handles failed tasks correctly.
* The brokers may fail to start due to the broker VIP taking slightly too long to create relative to how fast the brokers start.
* The brokers may be stuck in the STARTING state due to the readiness check in this version being too time sensitive when the brokers start quickly.
* Fixes to scheduler behavior during task status transitions.
* Dynamic ports are no longer sticky across pod replaces.
