Confluent Kafka is a distributed high-throughput publish-subscribe messaging system with strong ordering guarantees. Kafka clusters are highly available, fault tolerant, and very durable. DC/OS Confluent Kafka gives you direct access to the Confluent Kafka API so that existing producers and consumers can interoperate. You can configure and install DC/OS Confluent Kafka in moments. Multiple Confluent Kafka clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Confluent Kafka as a managed service to your organization.
