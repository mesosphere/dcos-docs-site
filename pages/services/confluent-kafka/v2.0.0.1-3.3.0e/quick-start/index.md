1. Install DC/OS on your cluster. See [the documentation](/1.10/installing/) for instructions.

1.  If you are using open source DC/OS, install a Beta Confluent Kafka cluster with the following command from the DC/OS CLI. If you are using Enterprise DC/OS, you may need to follow additional instructions. See the Install and Customize section for more information.

```
dcos package install confluent-kafka
```
<!-- stopped here -->
   Alternatively, you can install Beta Confluent Kafka from [the DC/OS web interface](/latest/usage/webinterface/).

Kafka will deploy with a default configuration. You can monitor deployment at the Services tab of the DC/OS web interface.

1. Connect a client to the service.
```
dcos confluent-kafka endpoints --name=confluent-kafka
[
  "zookeeper",
  "broker"
]
```
```
dcos confluent-kafka endpoints broker --name=confluent-kafka
{
  "address": [
    "10.0.1.161:1025",
    "10.0.1.6:1025",
    "10.0.3.205:1025"
  ],
  "dns": [
