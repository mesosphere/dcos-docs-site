## Backup

The service supports a custom plan for creating a consistent backup of the MongoDB replica set that is uploaded to a remote location. The backup plan launches an instance of [Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup), creates a consistent backup of the replica set and uploads the backup to remote storage.

Currently only AWS S3 is supported as an upload destination for backups via the plan named 'backup-s3'. More upload methods coming in the future!

There are two ways to configure backups, via the DC/OS Percona-Mongo service configuration section 'backup' in the DC/OS GUI and/or the DC/OS CLI.

### Hidden Secondary Member
The service supports the ability to launch a dedicated MongoDB [hidden secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-hidden-member/) replica set member for purpose of performing backups.

[Hidden secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-hidden-member/) members cannot become Primary in a failover situation and are hidden to application drivers.

The use of a dedicated backup secondary gurrantees backups *(a very resource-intensive process)* do not impact database nodes used by the application, therefore we recommend this is enabled when using backups. Enabling a hidden secondary will add a task named *'backup-0-mongod'* to the service. This node will inherit all settings from the other replica set nodes.

### Starting a Backup

Backups are started using the Percona-Mongo CLI module's `backup` command.

If the AWS Access Key, Secret Key, S3 Bucket Name and S3 Bucket Prefix are already defined in your service options the following will start a backup:
```bash
dcos percona-mongo backup run s3
```

If the AWS configuration/credentials are NOT defined in the service options or you would like to override them, define the options on the command line with the following:
```bash
dcos percona-mongo backup run s3 \
    --access-key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
    --secret-key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX \
    --bucket-name=my-s3-bucket-name \
    --bucket-prefix=/mongobackups \
    --region=eu-central-1
```

A successful start of the backup will return the following:
```bash
{
  "message": "Received cmd: start"
}
```

A task named *'mongodb-consistent-backup-0-backup'* will exist for the duration of the backup and upload.

### Stopping a Backup

To stop a running backup process:
```bash
dcos percona-mongo backup stop s3
```

### Troubleshooting a Backup

To troubleshoot problems with backups, add the flag *'--backup-verbose'* to the backup command. Please report any issues with mongodb_consistent_backup to [https://github.com/Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup/issues/new](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/mongodb_consistent_backup/issues/new).

Backups created by mongodb_consistent_backup can be restored manually using the [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore) command with the *'--oplogReplay'* flag included and the *'--host'* flag set to the host list provided by the 'mongo-port' endpoint. Include the *'--gzip'* flag if your backup used compression *(look for .bson.gz files)*.

## Restore

Restores using the DC/OS CLI or GUI are not yet supported. This must be done manually using a system that has a recent version of the 'mongodump' tool.

We recommend [mongorestore](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/) is used to restore backups manually against the service endpoint until restores are supported. Use the *'--oplogReplay'* flag with mongorestore to restore with point-in-time consistency. We recommend the *'--drop'** flag is used on restore to delete a collection before restoring it, preventing duplicate key errors, although use this with caution!

Example Restore *(mongorestore will prompt for password due to password equal to "")*:
```
mongorestore \
    --gzip \
    --drop \
    --oplogReplay \
    --host=<hostname> \
    --username=<username> \
    --password="" \
    --dir=/path/to/mongodump/dir
```
*Note: replace the flags '--host', '--username' and '--dir' above for your situation. 'hostname' should be equal to the 'mongo-port' endpoint DNS list*
