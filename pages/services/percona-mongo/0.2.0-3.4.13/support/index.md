## Package Versioning Scheme

- percona-mongo: 0.2.0-3.4.13
- DC/OS: 1.10 and 1.11

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of percona-mongo. For example, `0.2.0-3.4.13` indicates version `0.2.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.4.13` of Percona Server for MongoDB.
