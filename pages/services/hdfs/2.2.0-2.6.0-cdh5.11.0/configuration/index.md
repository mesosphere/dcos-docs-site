## Node Configuration

The node configuration objects correspond to the configuration for nodes in the HDFS cluster. Node configuration MUST be specified during installation and MAY be modified during configuration updates. All of the properties except `disk` and `disk_type` MAY be modified during the configuration update process.

### A Note on Memory Configuration

As part of the configuration for each node type, the amount of memory in MB allocated to the node can be specified. This value *must* be larger than the specified maximum heap size for the given node type. Make sure to allocate enough space for additional memory used by the JVM and other overhead. A good rule of thumb is allocate twice as much memory as the size of the heap (set using either `hdfs.hadoop_heapsize` or `<node type>.hadoop_<node type>node_opts`).

### A Note on Disk Types

As already noted, the disk size and type specifications cannot be modified after initial installation. Furthermore, the following disk volume types are available:

* `ROOT`: Data is stored on the same volume as the agent work directory and the node tasks use the configured amount of disk space.
* `MOUNT`: Data will be stored on a dedicated, operator-formatted volume attached to the agent. Dedicated MOUNT volumes have performance advantages and a disk error on these MOUNT volumes will be correctly reported to HDFS.

## HDFS File System Configuration

The HDFS file system network configuration, permissions, and compression are configured via the `hdfs` JSON object. Once these properties are set at installation time they can not be reconfigured.

## Operating System Configuration

In order for HDFS to function correctly, you must perform several important configuration modifications to the OS hosting the deployment. HDFS requires OS-level configuration settings typical of a production storage server.
