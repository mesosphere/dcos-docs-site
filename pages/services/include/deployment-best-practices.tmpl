- Use Mesosphere Enterprise DC/OS's placement rules to map your DSE cluster nodes or DC to different availability zones to achieve high resiliency.
- Set up a routine backup service using OpsCenter to back up your business critical data on a regular basis. The data can be stored on the DSE nodes themselves, or on AWS S3 buckets, depending on your IT policy or business needs.
- Set up a routine repair service using OpsCenter to ensure that all data on a replica is consistent within your DSE clusters.
