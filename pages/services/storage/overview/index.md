## Overview

DC/OS Storage Service (DSS) is a service that manages storage in DC/OS. This service manages volumes, volume profiles, volume providers, and storage devices in the cluster. The DSS serves as the brain of the storage support by collecting storage related information from various components in the cluster, keeping track of their states, and acting on user requests.
