# [Install]

## Prerequisites

- DC/OS Enterprise 1.11 or above.
- Storage feature flag is turned ON (`feature_dcos_storage_enabled: true` in config.yaml).
- <a href="https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/cli/install/">DC/OS CLI</a> is installed and has been logged in as a superuser.

## Build the local universe and artifacts server

Extract DC/OS Storage Service (DSS) package tarball. You should name the tarball `package.tgz`.<br>
**Note:** Do not delete the package after extraction.
```bash
$ tar zxvf package.tgz
$ cd package
```
Build the Docker image that will serve both the local universe and the artifacts used by DC/OS storage service. Specify the `DOCKER_IMAGE` environment variable, accordingly so that the image can be pushed to docker hub or your local docker registry.<br> 
**Note:** Do not specify the tag of the Docker image. The tag will be generated by the build script according to the version of the DSS package.

```bash
$ DOCKER_IMAGE=user/storage-artifacts universe/build.sh
```
The build script will generate some instructions for the next steps. Notice, that the `<SHA>` will be replaced with a real SHA1 value, reflecting the version of the DSS package. <br>
**Note:** Do not change the SHA value durng the instruction workflow.


**Steps:**

1. Push the docker image 'user/storage-artifacts:<SHA>'
```bash
:; docker push jieyu/storage-artifacts:<SHA>
```
2. Run the following marathon app in your cluster
```bash
:; dcos marathon app add /dev/stdin <<EOF
```
```json
{
  "id": "/storage-artifacts/<SHA>",
  "instances": 1,
  "cpus": 0.25,
  "mem": 128,
  "container": {
    "type": "MESOS",
    "docker": {
      "image": "jieyu/storage-artifacts:<SHA>",
      "forcePullImage": true
    },
    "portMappings": [
      {
        "containerPort": 80,
        "labels": {
          "VIP_0": "/storage-artifacts/<SHA>:10000"
        },
        "protocol": "tcp"
      }
    ]
  },
  "networks": [
    {
      "mode": "container/bridge"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```
3. Add the custom package repository
```bash
:; dcos package repo add storage-artifacts-<SHA> http://storage-artifacts<SHA>.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:10000/repo.json --index=0
```
4. Install the package
```bash 
:; dcos package install storage --package-version=<VERSION>
```
Follow the instructions and push the docker image that is build to a docker registry accessible in the cluster.

```bash 
$ docker push jieyu/storage-artifacts:<SHA>
```
## Launch the local universe and artifacts server

When the docker image has been pushed to the docker registry successfully, use the marathon config to launch a Marathon app that will serve the local universe and the storage artifacts.
```bash
$ cat <<EOF | dcos marathon app add /dev/stdin
```
```json
{
  "id": "/storage-artifacts/<SHA>",
  "instances": 1,
  "cpus": 0.25,
  "mem": 128,
  "container": {
    "type": "MESOS",
    "docker": {
      "image": "jieyu/storage-artifacts:<SHA>",
      "forcePullImage": true
    },
    "portMappings": [
      {
        "containerPort": 80,
        "labels": {
          "VIP_0": "/storage-artifacts/<SHA>:10000"
        },
        "protocol": "tcp"
      }
    ]
  },
  "networks": [
    {
      "mode": "container/bridge"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```
## Add the local universe

Wait for the Marathon app to be in “Running” state, and then add the local universe for the DSS package.
```bash
$ dcos package repo add storage-artifacts-<SHA> http://storage-artifacts<SHA>.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:10000/repo.json --index=0
```
## Install the DSS package

When the above step is successful, install the DSS package by using the below command. This command will install the DC/OS storage sub-command.
```bash
$ dcos package install storage --package-version=<VERSION>
```
## Verify that the DSS is running

Run the following command and wait for the DSS to be ready.
```bash
$ dcos storage version
```
