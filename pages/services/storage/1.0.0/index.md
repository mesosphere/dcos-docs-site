DC/OS Storage Service (DSS) is a service that manages volumes, volume profiles, volume providers, and storage devices in the DC/OS cluster.
The DSS serves as the brain of the storage support system by collecting storage related information from various components in the cluster, keeping track of their states, and acting on user requests.
