# Release notes for DC/OS Storage Service version 1.0.0

* This version of the DC/OS Storage Service is considered Generally Available and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade from previous versions.
* This version of the DC/OS Storage Service requires DC/OS Enterprise version 1.13.2 or later.

## New Features

* The `devices` volume provider now blacklists descendants of blacklisted devices by default. To override the default behavior, you can also explicitly blacklist a device using the `blacklist-exactly` configuration option.
* The `devices` and `lvm` volume providers now emit metrics. For more information see [New Metrics](#new-metrics).
* DSS can manage storage providers and volumes on agents that also advertise GPU resources.
* Operator can scrub volume removal operations that will never complete due to interrupted `DESTROY_DISK` operations.
* Operator can scrub local volumes and local volume providers that DSS reports as `MISSING`.
* Volume remove operations can be canceled. If no Mesos operations been issued to remove the volume, you can cancel the removal request.
* Operator can more easily remove failing providers from a node.
* The `dcos storage volume create` accepts create parameters via JSON file or `stdin`.
* The `dcos storage ...` commands accept a `-v` flag to toggle verbose logging.

## Updates

* Additional logging of API requests and responses.
* Enforce uniqueness of device provider names.
* More robust enforcement of non-overlapping devices among multiple `lvm` volume providers.
* Device provider creation validates that the target node is known to DSS.
* Prevent volume lifecycle operations when the parent provider is being modified, or is otherwise not ready.
* Prevent provider modifications when that provider has an in-progress volume operation.
* Removed permissions that are no longer needed by storage principal (related to marathon, package, storage service).
* DSS running on permissive mode clusters requires storage principal configuration.
* DSS running on strict mode clusters requires `enforce-authorization` to be enabled.
* `dcos storage ... list` commands display results in sorted order.
* `dcos storage provider list` table header `STATE` is now called `STATUS` (for consistency).
* Removed the `--all` flag from `dcos storage provider list`
* The `--timeout` flag sets a timeout after which the CLI will abort its operation instead of relying on the server to time out the operation. The CLI will keep retrying internally until the timeout is hit or a non-timeout error or success is achieved.
* Removed the previously deprecated "Artifacts Container" installation method.
* Secondary DSS instances will refuse to start if a primary instance is already running.
* Actively monitor Mesos heartbeats to DSS and trigger re-connection as needed.
* The DSS package includes a `LICENSES` file that contains copies of all OSS licenses.
* Service bug fixes, performance fixes, security fixes, as well as other doc fixes and improvements.

## Limitations

* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/ASF-2423 --> Only local volume storage is currently supported.
* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS-52744 --> Only manual [upgrades](../upgrades/) of a running DC/OS Storage Service on an existing cluster are supported at this time.
* Volume size must be a multiple of 4MiB, which is the default size of an LVM extent. Otherwise, DSS will reply with an error when attempting to create the volume.
* When planning to manually remove a logical volume via `lvremove`, the operator is responsible for zeroing the volume prior to removal.

## Known Issues

* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/ASF-1655 --> In the event of an unexpected device and/or volume change on an agent, you must restart the agent for the `devices` and `lvm` providers to reconcile the condition. For example, if you add or remove devices, restart the agent to update the `devices` volume provider with the changes.
* `dcos storage` CLI subcommands may fail with a gateway timeout error, but still complete successfully in the background.
* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/ASF-1655 --> The Mesos SLRP implementation is not yet compatible with multiple profiles that consume capacity from the same provider in different ratios (for example, RAID1 and linear). To work around this, create multiple providers, each of which is wholly dedicated to linear or RAID1.
* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS-44108 --> The storage service should only list providers that it currently manages; incompletely removed providers may be incorrectly listed in some cases.
* Deleting a volume may fail with "Cannot allocate memory" on some versions of CoreOS. To avoid this issue, ensure you are using a [supported version](/latest/version-policy/#dcos-platform-version-compatibility-matrix) of CoreOS.
* Kernels from (including) 3.10.0-862.6.3.el7 up to (including) 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7 may panic as a result of LVM operations (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3520511).
* The DC/OS installer may issue one or more *WARNING* messages regarding missing kernel modules:
    ```
    Checking if kernel module raid1 is loaded: WARNING Kernel module raid1 is not loaded. DC/OS Storage Service (DSS) depends on it.
    Checking if kernel module dm_raid is loaded: WARNING Kernel module dm_raid is not loaded. DC/OS Storage Service (DSS) depends on it.
    ```
    To resolve the issue, configure the `raid1` and `dm_raid` kernel modules to load at OS boot time.
* Using NVMe storage with DSS may require additional modifications to the underlying OS. For more information see these [suggested commands and helper scripts](/latest/storage/external-storage/#ebs-specific).
* <!-- https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS-54794 --> The device names (e.g. `sda`) used to create volume providers can be unstable over time thus [precautions](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/persistent_naming) should be taken to avoid this condition.
