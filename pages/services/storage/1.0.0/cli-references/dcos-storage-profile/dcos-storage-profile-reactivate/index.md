## dcos storage profile reactivate

Activate a profile that has been deactivated.

### Synopsis

Required arguments:

    <name>     The name of the volume profile.

Volume profiles cannot be changed once they have been created (i.e., they are
immutable) and they also cannot be removed. Instead of removing volume profiles,
you can deactivate a volume profile. No new volumes can be created with a
volume profile that has been deactivated.

This command activates a volume profile that has been deactivated. This means
volumes can be created once more using that volume profile. When a volume
profile is first created it is active by default.

```bash
dcos storage profile reactivate --name <name> [flags]
```

### Examples

1. Create a volume profile then deactivate it and try to create a volume of that profile:

```bash
# Create the 'safe' profile.
cat <<EOF | dcos storage profile create
{
    "name": "safe",
    "description": "Volumes backed by RAID-1 devices.",
    "spec": {
        "provider-selector": {
            "plugin": "lvm",
            "matches": {
                "labels": {"raid": "1"}
            }
        },
        "mount": {}
    }
}
EOF
```
```bash
# Create a volume from volume profile 'safe'.
dcos storage volume create --name my-volume-1 --capacity 10G --profile safe

# Deactivate the 'safe' volume profile.
dcos storage profile deactivate --name safe

# Try and create a new volume from volume profile 'safe'.
dcos storage volume create --name my-volume-2 --capacity 10G --profile safe
```
```
Error: Profile is not active.
```
```bash
# Reactivate the 'safe' volume profile again.
dcos storage profile reactivate --name safe

# Now create a new volume from volume profile 'safe'.
dcos storage volume create --name my-volume-2 --capacity 10G --profile safe
```
