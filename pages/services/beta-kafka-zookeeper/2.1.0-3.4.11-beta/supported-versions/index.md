# Package Versioning Scheme

- Apache ZooKeeper: 3.4.10
- DC/OS: 1.9 and higher

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Apache ZooKeeper. For example, `1.5.0-3.2.1` indicates version `1.5.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.2.1` of Apache ZooKeeper.

# Version Policy

The DC/OS Apache ZooKeeper Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of Apache ZooKeeper. We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from Apache ZooKeeper for new releases.
