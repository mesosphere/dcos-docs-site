# Accessing Logs

Logs for the scheduler and all service nodes can be viewed from the DC/OS web interface.

- Scheduler logs are useful for determining why a node is not being launched (this is under the purview of the scheduler).
- Node logs are useful for examining problems in the service itself.

In all cases, logs are generally piped to files named `stdout` and/or `stderr`.

To view logs for a given node, perform the following steps:

1. Visit <dcos-url> to access the DC/OS web interface.
1. Navigate to **Services** and click the service to be examined (default `kafka-zookeeper`).
1. In the list of tasks for the service, click the task to be examined (scheduler is named after the service, nodes are `zookeeper-<NUM>-server`. The ZooKeeper metrics tasks are `zookeeper-<NUM>-metrics`).
1. In the task details, click on the **Logs** tab to go into the log viewer. By default, you will see `stdout`, but `stderr` is also useful. Use the pulldown on the upper right to select the file to be examined.

You can also access the logs via the Mesos UI:

1. Visit <dcos-url>/mesos to view the Mesos UI.
1. Click the **Frameworks** tab in the upper left to get a list of services running in the cluster.
1. Navigate into the correct framework for your needs. The scheduler runs under `marathon` with a task name matching the service name (default `kafka-zookeeper`). Service nodes run under a framework whose name matches the service name (default `kafka-zookeeper`).
1. You should now see two lists of tasks. **Active Tasks** are tasks currently running, and **Completed Tasks** are tasks that have exited. Click the **Sandbox** link for the task you wish to examine.
1. The **Sandbox** view will list files named `stdout` and `stderr`. Click the file names to view the files in the browser, or click **Download** to download the file to your system for local examination.
   **Note:** Very old tasks will have their sandbox automatically deleted to limit disk space usage.

# Restarting a Node
If you must forcibly restart a node, use the following command to restart the node on the same agent node where it currently resides. This will not result in an outage or loss of data.

```shell
dcos kafka-zookeeper --name=<service-name> pod restart <node_id>
```

# Replacing a Permanently Failed Node
The DC/OS Apache ZooKeeper Service is resilient to temporary node failures. However, if a DC/OS agent hosting an Apache ZooKeeper node is permanently lost, manual intervention is required to replace the failed node. The following command should be used to replace the node residing on the failed server.

```shell
dcos kafka-zookeeper --name=<service-name> pod replace <node_id>
```
