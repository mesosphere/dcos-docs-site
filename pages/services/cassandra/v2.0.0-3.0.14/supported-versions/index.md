## Package Versioning Scheme

- Apache Cassandra: 3.0.14
- DC/OS: 1.8 and higher

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Apache Cassandra. For example, `1.8.0-3.0.14` indicates version `1.8.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.0.14` of Apache Cassandra.
