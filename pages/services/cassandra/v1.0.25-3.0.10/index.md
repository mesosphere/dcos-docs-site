Welcome to the documentation for the DC/OS Apache Cassandra. For more information about new and changed features, see the [release notes](https://github.com/mesosphere/dcos-cassandra-service/releases/).

DC/OS Apache Cassandra is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Cassandra on Mesosphere DC/OS. DC/OS Apache Cassandra eliminates nearly all of the complexity traditionally associated with managing a Cassandra cluster. [Apache Cassandra](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/2.2/cassandra/features.html) is a distributed database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many nodes, providing horizonal scalablity and high availability with no single point of failure, with a simple query language (CQL).

DC/OS Apache Cassandra gives you direct access to the Cassandra API so that existing applications can interoperate. You can configure and install DC/OS Apache Cassandra in moments. Multiple Cassandra clusters can be installed on DC/OS and managed independently, so you can offer Cassandra as a managed service to your organization.
