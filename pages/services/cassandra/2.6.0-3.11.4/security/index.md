# DC/OS {{ model.techName }} Security

- The DC/OS {{ model.techName }} service allows you to create a service account to configure access for {{ model.techName }}. The service allows you to create and assign permissions as required for access.  

- The DC/OS {{ model.techName }} service supports {{ model.techName }}'s native transport encryption mechanisms. The service provides automation and orchestration to simplify the usage of these important features.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>These security features are only available on DC/OS Enterprise 1.10 and later.</p>

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>It is possible to update a running DC/OS Apache Cassandra service to enable transport encryption after initial installation, but the service may be unavailable during the transition. Additionally, your clients will need to be reconfigured unless <tt>service.security.transport_encryption.allow_plaintext<tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>.</p>
