DC/OS Apache ZooKeeper is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Apache ZooKeeper on [DC/OS](https://mesosphere.com/product/) for the purposes of running the DC/OS Apache Kafka and DC/OS Confluent Kafka Services. ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration and naming information, as well as providing distributed synchronization and group services.

For more information on Apache ZooKeeper, see the [ZooKeeper documentation](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). In particular, the [ZooKeeper Admin Guide](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperAdmin.html).
