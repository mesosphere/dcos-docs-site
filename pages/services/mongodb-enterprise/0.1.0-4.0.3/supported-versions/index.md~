# Supported Versions

## Package Versioning Scheme

- MongoDB: 0.1.0-4.0.3

Packages are versioned with an a.b.c-x.y.z format, where a.b.c is the version of the DC/OS integration and x.y.z indicates the version of MongoDB. For example, 0.1.0-4.0.3 indicates version 0.1.0 of the DC/OS integration and version 4.0.3 of MongoDB.

## Version Policy

The DC/OS MongoDB Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of MongoDB.
