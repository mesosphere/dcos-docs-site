## Supported Versions

DC/OS and certified package version support policy are described in detail [here](https://docs.mesosphere.com/version-policy/).

## Package Versioning Scheme

- Percona XtraDB Cluster: 0.2.0-5.7.21

Packages are versioned with an a.b.c-x.y.z format, where a.b.c is the version of the DC/OS integration and x.y.z indicates the version of Percona XtraDB Cluster. For example, 0.2.0-5.7.21 indicates version 0.2.0 of the DC/OS integration and version 5.7.21 of Percona XtraDB Cluster.

## Version Policy

The DC/OS Percona XtraDB Cluster Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of Percona XtraDB Cluster.
