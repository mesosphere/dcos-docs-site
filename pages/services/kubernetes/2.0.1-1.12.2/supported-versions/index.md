# Package Versioning Scheme

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of Kubernetes.
For example, `1.0.0-1.9.3` indicates version `1.0.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `1.9.3` of Kubernetes.

# Version Policy

The DC/OS Kubernetes Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success.
We have selected the latest stable version of Kubernetes for new releases.
