Welcome to the documentation for the DC/OS {{ model.techName }}. For more information about new and changed features, see the [release notes](/services/spark/2.4.0-2.2.1-3/release-notes/).

{{ model.techName }} is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system for big data. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including {{ model.techShortName }} SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and {{ model.techShortName }} Streaming for stream processing. For more information, see the [{{ model.techName }} documentation][1].
