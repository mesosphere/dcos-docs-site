This section describes how to configure secure DC/OS service accounts for {{ model.techShortName }}.

When running in [DC/OS strict security mode](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/security/ent/#security-modes), both the dispatcher and jobs must authenticate to Mesos using a [DC/OS service account](/services/spark/2.8.0-2.4.0/security/#provision-a-service-account).

# Create and assign permissions

Use the following `curl` commands to rapidly provision the {{ model.techShortName }} service account with the required permissions. You can also provision the service account through the UI.

When running in [DC/OS strict security mode](/1.12/security/ent/#security-modes/), both the dispatcher and jobs must authenticate to Mesos using a [DC/OS service account](/1.12/security/ent/#service/).

Follow these instructions to [authenticate in strict mode](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/spark/spark-auth/).

# Using the secret store

DC/OS Enterprise allows users to add privileged information in the form of a file to the DC/OS secret store. These files can be referenced in {{ model.techShortName }} jobs and used for authentication and authorization with various external services (for example, HDFS). For example, you can use this functionality to pass Kerberos `keytab` files. For details about how to use secrets, see [understanding secrets](/1.12/security/ent/secrets/).

## Where to place secrets

For a secret to be available to {{ model.techShortName }}, it must be placed in a path
that can be accessed by the {{ model.techShortName }} service. If only {{ model.techShortName }} requires access to a secret, you can store the secret in a path that matches the name of the {{ model.techShortName }} service (for example, `spark/secret`).  See the [Secrets Documentation about Spaces][13] for details about how secret paths restrict service access to secrets.

## Limitations

Anyone who has access to the {{ model.techShortName }} (Dispatcher) service instance has access to all secrets available to it. Do not grant users access to the {{ model.techShortName }} Dispatchers instance unless they are also permitted to access all secrets available to the {{ model.techShortName }} Dispatcher instance.

## Binary secrets

You can store binary files, like a Kerberos keytab, in the DC/OS secrets store. In DC/OS 1.11 and later, you can create secrets from binary files directly. In DC/OS 1.10 or lower, files must be base64-encoded--as specified in RFC 4648--before being stored as secrets.

### DC/OS 1.11 and later

To create a secret called `mysecret` with the binary contents of `kerb5.keytab`, run the following command:

```bash
dcos security secrets create --file kerb5.keytab mysecret
```

### DC/OS 1.10 or earlier

To create a secret called `mysecret` with the binary contents of `kerb5.keytab`, first encode it using the `base64` command line utility. The following example uses BSD `base64` (default on macOS).

```bash
base64 -i krb5.keytab -o kerb5.keytab.base64-encoded
```

Alternatively, GNU `base64` (the default on Linux) inserts line-feeds in the encoded data by default.
Disable line-wrapping with the `-w 0` argument.

```bash
base64 -w 0 -i krb5.keytab > kerb5.keytab.base64-encoded
```

Now that the file is encoded, it can be stored as a secret.

```bash
dcos security secrets  create -f kerb5.keytab.base64-encoded  some/path/__dcos_base64__mysecret
```

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>The secret name <strong>must</strong> be prefixed with <code>__dcos_base64__</code>.</p>

When the `some/path/__dcos_base64__mysecret` secret is referenced in your `dcos spark run` command, its base64-decoded contents are made available as a [temporary file](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/secrets/#file-based-secrets) in your {{ model.techShortName }} application.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Make sure to only refer to binary secrets as files since holding binary content in environment variables is discouraged.</p>

# Using Mesos secrets

Once a secret has been added in the secret store, you can pass it to {{ model.techShortName }} with the `spark.mesos.<task-name>.secret.names` and `spark.mesos.<task-name>.secret.<filenames|envkeys>` configuration parameters, where `<task-name>` is either `driver` or `executor`. Specifying `filenames` or `envkeys` identifies the secret as either a file-based secret or an environment variable. These configuration parameters take comma-separated lists that are "zipped" together to make the final secret file or environment variable. In most cases, you should use file-based secrets whenever possible because they are more secure than environment variable secrets.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Secrets are only supported for the Mesos Universal containerizer and not for the Docker containerizer.</p>

To use the Mesos containerizer, add this configuration:

```
--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos
```

For example, to use a secret named `spark/my-secret-file` as a file in the driver **and** the executors, add these configuration parameters:
```
--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.names=spark/my-secret-file
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.filenames=target-secret-file
--conf spark.mesos.executor.secret.names=spark/my-secret-file
--conf spark.mesos.executor.secret.filenames=target-secret-file
```
These settings put the contents of the secret `spark/my-secret-file` in a secure RAM-FS mounted secret file named `target-secret-file` in the drivers' and executors' sandboxes. If you want to use a secret as an environment variable (for example, AWS credentials), you can change the configurations to be similar to the following:
```
--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.names=/spark/my-aws-secret,/spark/my-aws-key
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.envkeys=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
```
These example settings illustrate a secret access key stored in a secret named `spark/my-aws-secret` and a secret key ID in
`spark/my-aws-key`.

## Limitations

When using a combination of environment and file-based secrets, there must be an equal number of sinks and secret sources (files and environment variables). For example:

```
--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.names=/spark/my-secret-file,/spark/my-secret-envvar
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.filenames=target-secret-file,placeholder-file
--conf spark.mesos.driver.secret.envkeys=PLACEHOLDER,SECRET_ENVVAR
```

This code places the content of `spark/my-secret-file` into the `PLACEHOLDER` environment variable and the `target-secret-file` file as well as the content of `spark/my-secret-envvar` into the `SECRET_ENVVAR` and `placeholder-file`. In the case of binary secrets, the environment variable is empty because environment variables cannot be assigned binary values.

# {{ model.techShortName }} SSL

SSL support in DC/OS Apache {{ model.techShortName }} encrypts the following channels:

* From the [DC/OS admin router][11] to the dispatcher.
* Files served from the drivers to their executors.

To enable SSL, a Java keystore (and, optionally, truststore) must be provided, along with their passwords. The first three settings below are **required** during job submission. If using a truststore, the last two are also **required**:

| Variable                         | Description                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `--keystore-secret-path`         | Path to keystore in secret store                |
| `--keystore-password`            | The password used to access the keystore        |
| `--private-key-password`         | The password for the private key                |
| `--truststore-secret-path`       | Path to truststore in secret store              |
| `--truststore-password`          | The password used to access the truststore      |

In addition, there are a number of {{ model.techShortName }} configuration variables relevant to SSL setup.  These configuration settings
are **optional**:

| Variable                         | Description           | Default value |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| `spark.ssl.enabledAlgorithms`    | Allowed cyphers       | JVM defaults  |
| `spark.ssl.protocol`             | Protocol              | TLS           |

The keystore and truststore are created using the [Java keytool][12]. The keystore must contain one private key and its signed public key. The truststore is optional and might contain a self-signed root-CA certificate that is explicitly
trusted by Java.

Add the stores to your secrets in the DC/OS secret store. For example, if your keystores and truststores are `server.jks` and `trust.jks`, respectively, then use the following commands to add them to the secret store:

```bash
dcos security secrets create /spark/keystore --value-file server.jks
dcos security secrets create /spark/truststore --value-file trust.jks
```

You must add the following configurations to your `dcos spark run ` command.
The ones in parentheses are optional:

```bash

dcos spark run --verbose --submit-args="\
--keystore-secret-path=<path/to/keystore, e.g. spark/keystore> \
--keystore-password=<password to keystore> \
--private-key-password=<password to private key in keystore> \
(—-truststore-secret-path=<path/to/truststore, for example, spark/truststore> \)
(--truststore-password=<password to truststore> \)
(—-conf spark.ssl.enabledAlgorithms=<cipher, for example, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256> \)
--class <{{ model.techShortName }} Main class> <{{ model.techShortName }} Application JAR> [application args]"
```

**DC/OS 1.10 or earlier:** Since both stores are binary files, they must be base64 encoded before being placed in the DC/OS secret store. Follow the instructions above on encoding binary secrets to encode the keystore and truststore.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you specify environment-based secrets with <code>spark.mesos.[driver|executor].secret.envkeys</code>, the keystore and
truststore secrets will also show up as environment variable-based secrets because of how secrets are implemented. You can ignore these extra environment variables.</p>

# {{ model.techShortName }} SASL

This section discusses executor authentication and BlockTransferService encryption.

{{ model.techShortName }} uses Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) to authenticate executors with the driver and for encrypting messages sent between components. This functionality relies on a shared secret between all components you expect to communicate with each other. A secret can be generated with the DC/OS {{ model.techShortName }} CLI:

```bash
dcos spark secret <secret_path>
```
For example:

```
dcos spark secret /spark/sparkAuthSecret
```
This example generates a random secret and uploads it to the [DC/OS secrets store][14] at the designated path. To use this secret for RPC authentication, add the following configutations to your CLI command:

```bash
dcos spark run --submit-args="\
...
--executor-auth-secret=/spark/sparkAuthSecret
...
"
```
