**Note:** Custom Docker images are not supported by Mesosphere.

You can customize the Docker image in which Spark runs by extending the standard Spark Docker image. In this way, you can install your own libraries, such as a custom Python library.

1. In your Dockerfile, extend from the standard Spark image and add your customizations:

    ```
    FROM mesosphere/spark:1.0.4-2.0.1
    RUN apt-get install -y python-pip
    RUN pip install requests
    ```

1. Then, build an image from your Dockerfile.

        docker build -t username/image:tag .
        docker push username/image:tag

1. Reference your custom Docker image with the `--docker-image` option when running a Spark job.

        dcos spark run --docker-image=myusername/myimage:v1 --submit-args="http://external.website/mysparkapp.py 30"
