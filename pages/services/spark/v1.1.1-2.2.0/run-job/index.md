1.  Before submitting your job, upload the artifact (e.g., jar file)
    to a location visible to the cluster (e.g., HTTP, S3, or HDFS). [Learn more][13].

1.  Run the job.

        dcos spark run --submit-args="--class MySampleClass http://external.website/mysparkapp.jar 30"

        dcos spark run --submit-args="--py-files mydependency.py http://external.website/mysparkapp.py 30"

        dcos spark run --submit-args="http://external.website/mysparkapp.R"

    `dcos spark run` is a thin wrapper around the standard Spark `spark-submit` script. You can submit arbitrary pass-through options
to this script via the `--submit-args` options.

	The first time you run a job, the CLI must download the Spark distribution to your local machine. This may take a while.

	If your job runs successfully, you will get a message with the jobâ€™s submission ID:

        Run job succeeded. Submission id: driver-20160126183319-0001

1.  View the Spark scheduler progress by navigating to the Spark dispatcher at `http://<dcos-url>/service/spark/`.

1.  View the job's logs through the Mesos UI at `http://<dcos-url>/mesos/`.

# Setting Spark properties

Spark job settings are controlled by configuring [Spark properties][14]. You can set Spark properties during submission, or you can
create a configuration file.

## Submission

All properties are submitted through the `--submit-args` option to `dcos spark run`. These are ultimately passed to the
[`spark-submit` script][13].  View `dcos spark run --help` for a list of all these options.

Certain common properties have their own special names. You can view these through `dcos spark run --help`. Here is an example of
using `--supervise`:

    dcos spark run --submit-args="--conf spark.executor.memory=4g --supervise --class MySampleClass
http://external.website/mysparkapp.jar 30"

## Configuration file

To set Spark properties with a configuration file, create a
`spark-defaults.conf` file and set the environment variable
`SPARK_CONF_DIR` to the containing directory. [Learn more][15].

# DC/OS Overlay Network

To submit a Spark job inside the [DC/OS Overlay Network][16]:

    dcos spark run --submit-args="--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos --conf spark.mesos.network.name=dcos --class MySampleClass
http://external.website/mysparkapp.jar"

Note that DC/OS Overlay support requires the [UCR][17], rather than
the default Docker Containerizer, so you must set `--conf spark.mesos.containerizer=mesos`.

# Driver Failover Timeout

The `--conf spark.mesos.driver.failoverTimeout` option specifies the amount of time 
(in seconds) that the master will wait for the driver to reconnect, after being 
temporarily disconnected, before it tears down the driver framework by killing 
all its executors. The default value is zero, meaning no timeout: if the 
driver disconnects, the master immediately tears down the framework.

To submit a job with a nonzero failover timeout:

    dcos spark run --submit-args="--conf spark.mesos.driver.failoverTimeout=60 --class MySampleClass
http://external.website/mysparkapp.jar"

**Note:** If you kill a job before it finishes, the framework will persist 
as an `inactive` framework in Mesos for a period equal to the failover timeout. 
You can manually tear down the framework before that period is over by hitting
the [Mesos teardown endpoint][18].

# Versioning

The DC/OS Apache Spark Docker image contains OpenJDK 8 and Python 2.7.6.

DC/OS Apache Spark distributions 1.X are compiled with Scala 2.10.  DC/OS Apache Spark distributions 2.X are compiled with Scala
2.11.  Scala is not binary compatible across minor verions, so your Spark job must be compiled with the same Scala version as your
version of DC/OS Apache Spark.

The default DC/OS Apache Spark distribution is compiled against Hadoop 2.6 libraries.  However, you may choose a different version by
following the instructions in the "Customize Spark Distribution" section of the Installation page.
