## Package Versioning Scheme

- Percona-Server-MongoDB: 0.4.0-3.6.6
- DC/OS: 1.10 and 1.11

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` indicates the version of [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb). For example, `0.4.0-3.6.6` indicates version `0.4.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.6.6` of [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb).

## Version Policy

The DC/OS Percona Server for MongoDB Service is engineered and tested to work with a specific release of [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb). We select stable versions of the base technology in order to promote customer success. We have selected the latest stable version from [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb) for new releases.

The use of other [Percona Server for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongo-database/percona-server-for-mongodb) versions is unsupported and will likely cause issues.
