## Before you start

Currently, updating the package may trigger an update of a subset or
all the components managed by this framework, depending on whether new versions
of these components or related ones are part of the new release.

Updating these components means the Kubernetes cluster may experience some
downtime or, in the worst-case scenario, cease to function properly. And while
we are committed to make the user experience as robust and smooth as possible,
fact is there is no such thing as fail-proof software.

Before updating the package version, **proceed cautiously and always backup your data**.

In the future, we will be integrating the disaster-recovery functionality so
the user can easily revert to the previous functioning state.

### Updating package vs updating package options

When a new package is available, the user will have the option to update to
the new version. If the user hasn't updated the package in a while, it may be
that an update to the most recent package version is not allowed. If this is
the case, the user will be informed on how to proceed. Note that, the DC/OS Open
edition requires some additional [steps](#dcos-open-edition) to update the package version.

However, the user may simply want to update package options, for example, in
order to change the resources allocated to one type of Kubernetes component.
Do have in mind that package options updates may also mean the Kubernetes
cluster may experience some downtime or, in the worst-case scenario, cease to
function properly.

Before updating package options, **proceed cautiously and always backup your data**.

## Updating

In order to update the package, the `dcos beta-kubernetes update` subcommand
is available.

```shell
$ dcos beta-kubernetes update -h
usage: dcos beta-kubernetes [<flags>] update [<flags>]

Flags:
  -h, --help               Show context-sensitive help.
  -v, --verbose            Enable extra logging of requests/responses
      --name="kubernetes"  Name of the service instance to query
      --options=OPTIONS    Path to a JSON file containing the target package options
      --package-version=PACKAGE-VERSION
                           The target package version
      --yes                Do not ask for confirmation before starting the update process
      --timeout=1200s      Maximum time to wait for the update process to complete
```

**IMPORTANT:** If the user has a cluster with many Kubernetes nodes, we
recommend adjusting the `--timeout` value to a more generous number but we can't
calculate in advance what the value should be, given the amount of variables
involved, such as the DC/OS cluster resources available, CPU and internet speed,
etc.

### Updating the package version

Before starting the update process, it is mandatory to update the CLI
to the new version:

```shell
$ dcos package install beta-kubernetes --cli --package-version=<NEW_VERSION>
```

#### DC/OS Enterprise Edition

Below is how the user starts the package version update:

```shell
$ dcos beta-kubernetes update --package-version=<NEW_VERSION>
About to start an update from version <CURRENT_VERSION> to <NEW_VERSION>

Updating these components means the Kubernetes cluster may experience some
downtime or, in the worst-case scenario, cease to function properly.
Before updating proceed cautiously and always backup your data.

This operation is long-running and has to run to completion.
Are you sure you want to continue? [yes/no] yes

2018/03/01 15:40:14 starting update process...
2018/03/01 15:40:15 waiting for update to finish...
2018/03/01 15:41:56 update complete!
```

#### DC/OS Open Edition

In contrast to the Enterprise edition, the package upgrade requires some additional
steps to achieve the same result.

First, export the current package configuration into a JSON file called `config.json`:

```shell
$ dcos beta-kubernetes describe > config.json
```

In order to upgrade in a non-destructive manner, first remove the DC/OS Kubernetes
scheduler by running:

```shell
$ dcos marathon app remove /kubernetes
```

And then install the new version of the package:

```shell
$ dcos package install beta-kubernetes --package-version=<NEW_VERSION> --options=config.json
```

### Updating the package options

This package exposes certain options that advanced users can use to adapt
the Kubernetes cluster to their need. For instance, the user may want to
increase the `kube-apiserver` count or the resources available to `kube-proxy`.
As an example, we will describe how to achieve the latter.

Assuming the user has installed the package with its default options, all
that's required is for the user to create a JSON file with the following
contents:

```json
{
  "kube_proxy": {
    "cpus": 0.5,
    "mem": 1024
  }
}
```

And, assuming the file is saved as `new_options.json`, run:

```shell
$ dcos beta-kubernetes update --options=new_options.json
```

Below is the expected output. Mind that the changes are highlighted with the
text `(CHANGED)`:

```shell
The following differences were detected between service configurations (CHANGED, CURRENT):
 ==  {
 ==  "kube_proxy": {
 -      "cpus": 0.1,
 +      "cpus": 0.5,
 -      "mem": 512,
 +      "mem": 1024,
 ==  }
 == }

The components of the cluster will be updated according to the changes in the
options file [new_options.json].

Updating these components means the Kubernetes cluster may experience some
downtime or, in the worst-case scenario, cease to function properly.
Before updating proceed cautiously and always backup your data.

This operation is long-running and has to run to completion.
Are you sure you want to continue? [yes/no] yes

2018/03/01 15:40:14 starting update process...
2018/03/01 15:40:15 waiting for update to finish...
2018/03/01 15:41:56 update complete!
```

#### Noteworthy package options

Some package options are special in the sense that they **must** only ever be
updated **once** after package installation, and only towards a specific target
value. These package options are

* `kubernetes.cloud_provider`: must only be updated if the initial value for the
  option is `""` and the target value is `"aws"`.
* `kubernetes.high_availability`: must only be updated if the initial value for
  the option is `false` and the target value is `true`.

Also, some package options **must not** be changed **at all** after the package
is installed for the first time. Those package options are:

* `etcd.data_disk`
* `etcd.disk_type`
* `etcd.wal_disk`
* `kubernetes.network_provider`
* `kubernetes.service_cidr`
* `service.name`
* `kubernetes.authorization_mode`

Please make sure you understand and respect these rules. Otherwise you may
render your cluster unusable and risk losing data.

## Updating the package options in pre-`1.2.0-1.10.5` versions

Users running versions of DC/OS Kubernetes that precede `1.2.0-1.10.5` are
strongly advised to update to this version. In case the update is not possible
or desired, users are strongly encouraged to perform a couple of manual steps
before updating their cluster's options (e.g. before updating the amount of RAM
allocated to Kubernetes nodes) in order to avoid a behavior that can cause
cluster downtime during the update operation. These manual steps consist in
restarting the framework scheduler, and making sure it gracefully recovers from
the restart and detects the `deploy` plan as having reached the `COMPLETE`
state. In order to do this, the following steps can be followed:

1. Forcing the framework scheduler to restart:

   ```
   $ dcos marathon app kill /<SERVICE_NAME>
   ```

   `<SERVICE_NAME>` must be replaced by the name of the service (e.g.
   `kubernetes`).

1. Making sure the framework scheduler successfully recovers and that the
   `deploy` plan is complete:

   ```
   $ dcos beta-kubernetes --name=<SERVICE_NAME> plan show deploy
   deploy (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
   (...)
   ```

   `<SERVICE_NAME>` must be replaced by the name of the service (e.g.
   `kubernetes`). It can take a couple of minutes for this command to start
   producing a successful result.
