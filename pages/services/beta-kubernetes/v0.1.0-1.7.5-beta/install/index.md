The default DC/OS Kubernetes Service installation provides reasonable defaults for trying out the service. This service is not currently certified for production use.

## Prerequisites

- If you are using Enterprise DC/OS, you must install the [Enterprise CLI](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.9/cli/enterprise-cli/) and [provision a service account](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/security/service-auth/custom-service-auth/) before installing DC/OS Kubernetes Service. Only someone with `superuser` permission can create the service account.
  - `strict` [security mode](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/security/ent/service-auth/) requires a service account.
  - In `permissive` security mode, a service account is optional.
  - `disabled` security mode does not require a service account.
- Your cluster must have at least 3 private nodes with: 6 CPU | 5654 MB MEM | 615 MB Disk. For larger deployments, refer to the resource requirements of each component, on each node.

# Installing from the DC/OS CLI

To start a basic test cluster of Kubernetes, run the following command on the DC/OS CLI. Enterprise DC/OS users must follow additional instructions. [More information about installing Kubernetes on Enterprise DC/OS](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/security/service-auth/custom-service-auth/).

```shell
dcos package install beta-kubernetes
```

You can specify a custom configuration in an `options.json` file and pass it to `dcos package install` using the `--options` parameter.

```shell
dcos package install beta-kubernetes --options=options.json
```

**Recommendation:** Store your custom configuration in source control.

For more information on building the `options.json` file, see [DC/OS documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/usage/managing-services/config-universe-service/) for service configuration access.

## Installing from the DC/OS Web Interface

You can [install Kubernetes from the DC/OS web interface](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/usage/managing-services/install/). If you install Kubernetes from the web interface, you must install the DC/OS Kubernetes CLI subcommands separately. From the DC/OS CLI, enter:

```shell
dcos package install beta-kubernetes --cli
```

Go to the [Advanced Installation](/service-docs/beta-kubernetes/v0.1.0-1.7.5-beta/advanced-install) for details on performing a custom installation.
