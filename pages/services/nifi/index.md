Apache NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation and system mediation logic. Apache NiFi has a web-based user interface for design, control, feedback, and monitoring of dataflows. It is highly configurable along several dimensions of quality of service, such as loss-tolerant versus guaranteed delivery, low latency versus high throughput and priority-based queuing. Apache NiFi provides fine-grained data provenance for all data received, forked, joined cloned, modified, sent and ultimately dropped upon reaching its configured end-state.
