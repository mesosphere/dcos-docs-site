## Backup

ZooKeeper backup and restore operations are typically done by creating copies of the latest data and log directories generated by the cluster. This can be done by SSHing into a node and manually copying the files you want to restore. The data directory is named `zookeeper-data-directory` and the log directory is named `zookeeper-log-directory`.

Use the [task exec utility](https://dcos.io/docs/1.9/monitoring/debugging/task-exec/) to go directly into the Mesos sandbox of a node.

```bash
dcos task exec -it zookeeper-<NUM> /bin/bash
```

This command puts you in your Mesos sandbox in an interactive bash environment. From here, go into the `zookeeper-data-path` or `zookeeper-log-path` directory and `cp` or `scp` files to a desired location, preferably one away from the network, in case of outage.

## Restore

To restore a cluster to a particular state, stop the cluster, restore the latest (or desired) log file to the `zookeeper-log-path`, and restart the cluster from that state.

It is best practice to keep 3-5 of the latest, desired log files in case the restored log file restores the cluster to an invalid state with ephemeral nodes. You can update ZooKeeper-specific configurations like `autopurge.Interval` to manage the purging of superfluous files.
