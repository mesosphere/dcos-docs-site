<!-- The following limitations are unique to this service. -->

## Scaling Out

{{ model.techName }} does not support horizontal scaling; if your {{ model.techName }} cluster has started with eight {{ model.techName }} servers, then a ninth {{ model.techName }} server cannot be added to the {{ model.techName }} cluster.

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong> Minio does not support Horizontal Scaling.</p>

## Auto Assignment of Ports

Auto assignment of ports is not supported by the {{ model.techName }} framework. {{ model.techName }} must be bound to the same port on each node to start in distributed mode. Enabling auto assignment of ports may result in binding the {{ model.techName }} server to different ports on each Pod.
