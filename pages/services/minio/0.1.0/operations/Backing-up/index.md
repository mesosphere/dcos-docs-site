The {{ model.techName }} service allows you to back up your data to AWS S3-compatible storage. To back up data to an AWS S3-compatible bucket, {{ model.techName }} uses the `mc mirror` command. {{ model.techName }} provides an `rsync`-like command line utility. It mirrors data from one bucket to another. The following information and values are required to back up your data.

## Prerequisites

The following values are required to back up your data:

  1. ACCESS_KEY_ID
  2. SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Set your plan parameters as follows:

```shell
{
 'ACCESS_KEY_ID': access_key_id,
 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY': secret_access_key
}
``` 

Backup will be performed using the following sidecar task:

The backup task is responsible for making a backup of the data in the {{ model.techName }} storage to the AWS S3-compatible storage. 

## Back up
    
1. Run the following command to start your backup plan:

    ```shell
    {
    dcos miniod --name=<service_name> plan start <plan_name> -p <plan_parameters>
    }
    ```

1. To launch the backup plan, run the following command with the requisite parameters:

    ```shell
    {
    dcos miniod --name=<SERVICE_NAME> plan start backup \
      -p ACCESS_KEY_ID=<ACCESS_KEY> \
      -p SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    }
    ````

    Once this plan is executed, the backup will be uploaded to S3-compatible storage.



1. A backup task will run the `mc mirror` command by taking ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as parameters.

1. It will create new buckets in the AWS S3-compatible storage according to the current snapshot or state of the {{ model.techName }} storage system. 

1. While creating a bucket in S3-compatible storage during backup, the task service name will be attached to the prefix of the actual bucket name in {{ model.techName }}. 

1. A `synchronize-buckets` command will delete the buckets in the AWS S3-compatible storage which were deleted in the {{ model.techName }} since the last backup. 

1. A separate Pod will be started at any Private Agent. 

1. An init script will register both {{ model.techName }} as well as an S3-compatible client.

A `backup` plan would execute the aforementioned tasks serially. 

## Specifying an S3-compatible storage endpoint

While deploying the service from a catalog, you can specify S3-compatible storage by providing the URL of that storage.
