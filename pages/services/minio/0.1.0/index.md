DC/OS {{ model.techName }} Service is an automated service that makes it easy to deploy and manage {{ model.techName }} on Mesosphere [DC/OS](https://mesosphere.com/product/). For more information on {{ model.techName }}, see the [{{ model.techName }} documentation](https://docs.minio.io/).

<p class="message--warning"><strong>WARNING: </strong>This is a Community service. Community services are not tested for production environments. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.</p>

## Benefits
DC/OS {{ model.techName }} offers the following benefits:
1. Based on the proven DC/OS framework/operator SDK underpinning all DC/OS-certified frameworks
2. {{ model.techName }} is a lightweight object storage server
3. {{ model.techName }} deploys Amazon S3-compatible object storage servers in seconds
4. Provides consistent deployment across multi-cloud environments
5. Backup and restore operations use AWS S3 as backing store

## DC/OS {{ model.techName }}'s main features are:
1. **Erasure Code**: DC/OS {{ model.techName }} protects data against hardware failures and silent data corruption using erasure code and checksums.
2. **Bit rot protection**: DC/OS {{ model.techName }} provides bit rot protection using the HighwayHash algorithm.
3. **Bucket Notification Service**: DC/OS {{ model.techName }} provides a bucket notification service. Events occurring on objects in a bucket can be monitored using bucket event notifications.
4. **Gateway**: DC/OS {{ model.techName }} adds Amazon S3 compatibility to Azure Blob Storage, GCP and NAS.
5. **Large Bucket Support**: Allows a single DC/OS {{ model.techName }} bucket to expand over multiple erasure code deployment sets.
6. **Disk Cache**: Disk caching allows caching disks to store content closer to  tenants.
7. **Monitoring**: DC/OS {{ model.techName }} server exposes monitoring data over  unauthenticated endpoints, so monitoring tools can pick the data without you having to share DC/OS {{ model.techName }} server credentials.

## Dynamic Scaling Out

DC/OS {{ model.techName }} does not support horizontal scaling;  if a DC/OS {{ model.techName }} cluster has started with eight DC/OS {{ model.techName }} servers then a ninth DC/OS {{ model.techName }} server cannot be added to the cluster.
