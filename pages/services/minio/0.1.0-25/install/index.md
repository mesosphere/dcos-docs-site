 DCOS Minio is available in the Universe and can be installed by using either the web interface or the DC/OS CLI.

The default DC/OS Minio Service installation provides reasonable defaults for trying out the service, but that may not be sufficient for production use. You may require different configurations depending on the context of the deployment.
