## Package Versioning Scheme

- Confluent Kafka: 3.2.0
- DC/OS: 1.9 and higher

Packages are versioned with an `a.b.c-x.y.z` format, where `a.b.c` is the version of the DC/OS integration and `x.y.z` in dicates the version of Confluent Kafka. For example, `1.10.0-3.2.0` indicates version `1.10.0` of the DC/OS integration and version `3.2.0` of Confluent Kafka.
