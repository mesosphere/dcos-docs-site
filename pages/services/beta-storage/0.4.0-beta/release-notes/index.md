## Updates

* Added the `--all` flag for the `list` action of storage CLI sub-commands `profile`, `provider`, and `volume`.
* The `--timeout` flag, added to all storage CLI sub-commands, limits the time that the CLI waits for a storage service response.
* Improved error reporting for storage CLI sub-commands.
* Improved interoperability with other DC/OS CLI sub-commands.
* Emitted statsd metrics use `_` instead of `.` as a sub-label separator.
* Additional metrics for previously untracked Mesos API interactions.
* Increased verbosity for debug logging in the RPC layer.
* Support for performance diagnosis at run-time.
* Configurable CPU, memory, and disk resource usage for the DC/OS Storage Service itself.
* Improvements to Mesos offer handling to improve throughput and reduce offer contention.
* Documentation corrections and enhancements.
* Various other bug fixes.

## Limitations

DC/OS Storage Service is currently in Beta and has the following known limitations.

* Only local volume storage is currently supported.
* Volume profile deactivation is not supported.
* Removing the devices provider from a node is not supported.
* Automated [upgrades](../upgrades/) of a running DC/OS Storage Service on an existing cluster are not yet supported.
* The service must be deployed in a DC/OS cluster running in `strict` [security](/latest/security/ent/#security-modes) mode when configured with a service account and corresponding secret.
