## dcos storage profile

Manage volume profiles.

### Synopsis

A volume profile represents volumes based on volume provider or volume
parameters and labels. For example, if you want to differentiate between HDDs
and SSDs for different purposes, you can create a `fast` volume profile that
identifies your SSDs and a `slow` volume profile that identifies your HDDs. If
your framework, say Cassandra, distinguishes between "cache" and "archive"
storage you can then configure it to map your `fast` volume profile to
Cassandra's "cache" storage and your `slow` volume profile to Cassandra's
"archive" storage.

```bash
dcos storage profile [flags]
```
