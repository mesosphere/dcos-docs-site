By default, a [new user](/1.9/security/ent/users-groups/) has no permissions and cannot view the [DC/OS GUI](/1.9/gui/). You must grant users and groups access to each tab of the GUI.

**Important:** Only [superusers](/1.9/security/ent/perms-reference/#superuser) can view the Dashboard, Nodes, and System Overview tabs.
