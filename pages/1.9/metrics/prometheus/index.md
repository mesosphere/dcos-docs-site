The Prometheus metrics plugin supports sending metrics from the DC/OS metrics service to a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server. You must install a plugin on each node in your cluster. This plugin works with DC/OS 1.9.4 and higher.

**Prerequisite:**

- DC/OS is [installed](/1.9/installing/oss/)

# Install the DC/OS Prometheus metrics plugin

For each node in your cluster, download the plugin binary and then add a systemd unit to manage the service. This unit differs slightly between master and agent nodes.

1. On every node in your cluster:

   1. Download the latest Prometheus plugin binary from downloads.mesosphere.io: [prometheus-plugin](https://downloads.mesosphere.io/dcos-metrics/plugins/prometheus)
   1. Rename the plugin to `dcos-metrics-prometheus` and move to `/opt/mesosphere/bin`.
   1. Assign permissions to the plugin: `chmod 0755 /opt/mesosphere/bin/dcos-metrics-prometheus`.

1.  On every master node:
    1. Download the plugin systemd service file from downloads.mesosphere.io: [prometheus-plugin.service](https://downloads.mesosphere.io/dcos-metrics/plugins/prometheus.service)
    1. Copy the service file to `/etc/systemd/system/dcos-metrics-prometheus.service`. Edit it and ensure that the dcos-role flag is set to 'master'.

        ```
        [Unit]
        Description=DC/OS Metrics Prometheus Plugin

        [Service]
        ExecStart=/opt/mesosphere/bin/dcos-metrics-prometheus -dcos-role master
        ```

    2. Reload the systemd state by running `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
    3. Start the systemd service with `sudo systemctl start dcos-metrics-prometheus`.
    4. View the system logs and verify the plugin is running with `sudo journalctl -u dcos-metrics-prometheus`.

1.  On every agent node:
    1. Download the plugin systemd service file from downloads.mesosphere.io: [prometheus-plugin.service](https://downloads.mesosphere.io/dcos-metrics/plugins/prometheus.service)
    1. Copy the service file to `/etc/systemd/system/dcos-metrics-prometheus.service`. Edit it and ensure that the dcos-role flag is set to 'agent'.

        ```
        [Unit]
        Description=DC/OS Metrics Prometheus Plugin

        [Service]
        ExecStart=/opt/mesosphere/bin/dcos-metrics-prometheus -dcos-role agent
        ```

    2. Reload the systemd state by running `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
    3. Start the systemd service with `sudo systemctl start dcos-metrics-prometheus`.
    4. View the system logs and verify the plugin is running with `sudo journalctl -u dcos-metrics-prometheus`.

# Run a Prometheus server

1. Download a [Prometheus Marathon app definition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/dcos-metrics/master/plugins/prometheus/marathon/prometheus.json).
2. Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file. 
3. Configure the IP address of each node and the Prometheus port configured in the environment file in the `static_configs` array in the [`scrape_configs`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<scrape_config>) section.
2. Run the app with `dcos marathon app add prometheus.json`.

# Test a metric emitter

1. Download the [ statsd-emitter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/dcos-metrics/master/plugins/prometheus/marathon/statsd-emitter.json) test task.
1. Run the app with `dcos marathon app add statsd-emitter.json`.
1. Check your Prometheus frontend for the `statsd_tester_time_uptime` metric. For example:

   ![statsd_tester_time_uptime](/1.9/img/statsd_tester_time_uptime.png)
