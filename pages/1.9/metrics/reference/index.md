| memory.buffers         |   Number of memory buffers.     |
| memory.cached         |   Amount of cached memory.   |
| memory.free         |    Amount of free memory in bytes.   |

| swap.free         |  Amount of free swap space.   |
| swap.total         |  Total swap space.    |
| swap.used         |    Amount of swap space used.    |
| system.uptime          |   The system reliability and load average.    |

### Filesystem metrics

| Metric            | Description                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| filesystem.capacity.free    | Amount of available capacity in bytes. |
| filesystem.capacity.total    | Total capacity in bytes. |
| filesystem.capacity.used    |  Capacity used in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.free    | Amount of available inodes in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.total    | Total inodes in bytes. |
| filesystem.inode.used    | Inodes used in bytes.  |

**Note:** The tag `path` is automatically populated based on the mount path of the local filesystem (e.g., `/`, `/boot`, etc).

### Network interface metrics

| Metric            | Description                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| network.in.bytes    | Number of bytes downloaded. |
| network.in.dropped    | Number of downloaded bytes dropped. |
| network.in.errors    | Number of downloaded bytes in error. |
| network.in.packets    | Number of packets downloaded. |
| network.out.bytes    | Number of bytes uploaded. |
| network.out.dropped    | Number of uploaded bytes dropped. |
| network.out.errors    | Number of uploaded bytes in error.  |
| network.out.packets    | Number of packets uploaded. |

**Note:** The tag `interface` is automatically populated based on the type of the network interface (e.g., `spartan`, `d-dcos`, `minuteman`, etc).
