# Hardware Prerequisites

You must have a single Bootstrap node, Mesos master nodes, and Mesos agent nodes.

## Bootstrap node

1 node with 2 cores, 16 GB RAM, 60 GB HDD. This is the node where DC/OS installation is run. This bootstrap node must also have:

*  A high-availability (HA) TCP/Layer 3 load balancer, such as HAProxy, to balance the following TCP ports to all master nodes: 80, 443.
*  An unencrypted SSH key that can be used to authenticate with the cluster nodes over SSH. Encrypted SSH keys are not supported.

## Cluster nodes

The cluster nodes are designated Mesos masters and agents during installation.

The supported operating systems and environments are listed on the [version policy page](/version-policy/).

### Master nodes

The below table represents the master node hardware requirements:

|             | Minimum   | Recommended |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Nodes       | 1         | 3 or 5   |
| Processor   | 4 cores   | 4 cores     |
| Memory      | 32 GB RAM | 32 GB RAM   |
| Hard disk   | 120 GB    | 120 GB      |

There are many mixed workloads on the masters, for example Mesos replicated log and ZooKeeper. Some of these require fsync()ing every so often, and this can generate a lot of very expensive random I/O. We recommend the following:

- Solid-state drive (SSD)
- RAID controllers with a BBU
- RAID controller cache configured in writeback mode

### Agent nodes

The below table represents the agent node hardware requirements:

|             | Minimum   | Recommended |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Nodes       | 1         | 6 or more   |
| Processor   | 2 cores   | 2 cores     |
| Memory      | 16 GB RAM | 16 GB RAM   |
| Hard disk   | 60 GB     | 60 GB       |

The agent nodes must also have:

- A `/var` directory with 10 GB or more of free space. This directory is used by the sandbox for both [Docker and DC/OS Universal container runtime](/1.9/deploying-services/containerizers/).
- The agent's work directory, `/var/lib/mesos/slave`, should be on a separate device. This protects all the other services from a task overflowing the disk.

  - To maintain backwards compatibility with frameworks written before the disk resource was introduced, by default the disk resource is not enforced.
  - You can enable resource enforcement by inserting the environment variable MESOS_ENFORCE_CONTAINER_DISK_QUOTA=true into one of the Mesos agent extra config files (e.g. `/var/lib/dcos/mesos-slave-common`).
- Network Access to a public Docker repository or to an internal Docker registry.

*   On RHEL 7 and CentOS 7, firewalld must be stopped and disabled. It is a [known Docker issue](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/16137) that `firewalld` interacts poorly with Docker. For more information, see the [Docker Engine release notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/).

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop firewalld && sudo systemctl disable firewalld
    ```

*   DC/OS is installed to `/opt/mesosphere`. `/opt/mesosphere` must be on the same mountpoint as `/`.  This is required because DC/OS installs systemd unit files under `/opt/mesosphere`. All systemd units must be available for enumeration during the initializing of the initial ramdisk at boot. If `/opt` is on a different partition or volume, systemd will fail to discover these units during the initialization of the ramdisk and DC/OS will not automatically restart upon reboot.

*   The Mesos master and agent persistent information of the cluster is stored in the `var/lib/mesos` directory.

    **Important:** Do not remotely mount `/var/lib/mesos` or the Docker storage directory (by default `/var/lib/docker`).

*   Mounting `noexec` on a system where you intend to use the DC/OS CLI could break CLI functionality unless a TMPDIR environment variable is set to something other than `/tmp/`.

### <a name="port-and-protocol"></a>Port and Protocol Configuration

*   Secure Shell (SSH) must be enabled on all nodes.
*   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) must be enabled on all nodes.
*   All hostnames (FQDN and short hostnames) must be resolvable in DNS; both forward and reverse lookups must succeed.
*   Each node is network accessible from the bootstrap node.
*   Each node has unfettered IP-to-IP connectivity from itself to all nodes in the DC/OS cluster.
*   All ports should be open for communication from the master nodes to the agent nodes and vice versa.
*   UDP must be open for ingress to port 53 on the masters. To attach to a cluster, the Mesos agent node service (`dcos-mesos-slave`) uses this port to find `leader.mesos`.

### High Speed Internet Access

High speed internet access is recommended for DC/OS installation. A minimum 10 MBit per second is required for DC/OS services. The installation of some DC/OS services will fail if the artifact download time exceeds the value of MESOS_EXECUTOR_REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT within the file `/opt/mesosphere/etc/mesos-slave-common`. The default value for MESOS_EXECUTOR_REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT is 10 minutes.

# Software Prerequisites

**Tip:** Refer to [this shell script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/dcos/1.9.1/cloud_images/centos7/install_prereqs.sh) for an example of how to install the software requirements for DC/OS masters and agents on a CentOS 7 host.

* Refer to [install_prereqs.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/dcos/1.10/cloud_images/centos7/install_prereqs.sh) script for an example of how to install the software requirements for DC/OS masters and agents on a CentOS 7 host.[enterprise type="inline" size="small" /]

* When using OverlayFS over XFS, the XFS volume should be created with the -n ftype=1 flag. Please see the [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.2_release_notes/technology-preview-file_systems) and [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/container-image/#provisioner-backends) documentation for more details.

## All Nodes

### Docker

Docker must be installed on all bootstrap and cluster nodes. The supported Docker versions are listed on the [version policy page](/version-policy/).

**Recommendations**

* Do not use Docker `devicemapper` storage driver in `loop-lvm` mode. For more information, see [Docker and the Device Mapper storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/).

* Choose `OverlayFS` or `devicemapper` in `direct-lvm` mode when choosing a production storage driver. For more information, see Docker's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/" target="_blank">Select a Storage Driver</a>.

* Manage Docker on CentOS with systemd. systemd handles starting Docker on boot and restarting it when it crashes.

* Run Docker commands as the root user (with `sudo`) or as a user in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/centos/#create-a-docker-group" target="_blank">docker user group</a>.

**Distribution-Specific Installation**

Each Linux distribution requires Docker to be installed in a specific way:

*   **CentOS** - [Install Docker from Docker's yum repository][2].
*   **RHEL** - Install Docker by using a subscription channel. For more information, see <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893" target="_blank">Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems</a>. <!-- curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh -->
*   **CoreOS** - Comes with Docker pre-installed and pre-configured.

For more more information, see Docker's <a href="http://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/" target="_blank">distribution-specific installation instructions</a>.

### Disable sudo password prompts

To use the [GUI][4] or [CLI][1] installation methods, you must disable password prompts for sudo.

Add the following line to your `/etc/sudoers` file. This disables the sudo password prompt.

```bash
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Alternatively, you can SSH as the root user.

### Enable Time synchronization

Time synchronization is a core requirement of DC/OS. There are various methods
of ensuring time sync. NTP is the typical approach on bare-metal.
Many cloud providers use hypervisors, which push time
down to the VM guest operating systems. In certain circumstances, hypervisor
time-sync may conflict with NTP.

You must understand how to properly configure time synchronization for your
environment. When in doubt, enable NTP and check using `/opt/mesosphere/bin/check-time`.

#### Enable Check Time

You must set the `ENABLE_CHECK_TIME` environment variable in order for
 `/opt/mesosphere/bin/check-time` to function. It's recommended
that you enable this globally. e.g. on CoreOS an entry in `/etc/profile.env`
of `export ENABLE_CHECK_TIME=true` with set the appropriate variable.

#### Using NTP

Network Time Protocol (NTP) must be enabled on all nodes for clock synchronization. By default, during DC/OS startup you will receive an error if this is not enabled. You can check if NTP is enabled by running one of these commands, depending on your OS and configuration:

```bash
ntptime
adjtimex -p
timedatectl
```


## Bootstrap node

Before installing DC/OS, you must ensure that your bootstrap node has the following prerequisites.

**Important:**

* If you specify `exhibitor_storage_backend: zookeeper`, the bootstrap node is a permanent part of your cluster. With `exhibitor_storage_backend: zookeeper` the leader state and leader election of your Mesos masters is maintained in Exhibitor ZooKeeper on the bootstrap node. For more information, see the configuration parameter [documentation](/1.9/installing/oss/custom/configuration/configuration-parameters/).
* The bootstrap node must be separate from your cluster nodes.

### <a name="setup-file"></a>DC/OS setup file

[Download and save](https://dcos.io/releases/) the DC/OS setup file to your bootstrap node. This file is used to create your customized DC/OS build file. Contact your sales representative or <a href="mailto:sales@mesosphere.com">sales@mesosphere.com</a> for access to this file.

### Docker Nginx (advanced installer)

For advanced install only, install the Docker Nginx image with this command:

```bash
sudo docker pull nginx
```

## Cluster nodes

For advanced install only, your cluster nodes must have the following prerequisites. The cluster nodes are designated as Mesos masters and agents during installation.

### Data compression (advanced installer)

You must have the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html" target="_blank">UnZip</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/" target="_blank">GNU tar</a>, and <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/" target="_blank">XZ Utils</a> data compression utilities installed on your cluster nodes.

To install these utilities on CentOS7 and RHEL7:

```bash
sudo yum install -y tar xz unzip curl ipset
```


### Cluster permissions (advanced installer)

On each of your cluster nodes, use the following command to:

*   Disable SELinux or set it to permissive mode.
*   Add `nogroup` and `docker` to each of your Mesos masters and agents.
*   Reboot your cluster for the changes to take effect.

    ```bash
    sudo sed -i s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g /etc/selinux/config &&
    sudo groupadd nogroup &&
    sudo groupadd docker &&
    sudo reboot
    ```

    **Note:** It may take a few minutes for your node to come back online after reboot.

### Locale requirements
You must set the `LC_ALL` and `LANG` environment variables to `en_US.utf-8`.

- For info on setting these variables in Red Hat, see [How to change system locale on RHEL](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/974273)

- On Linux:
````
localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.utf8
````

- For info on setting these variable in CentOS7, see [How to set up system locale on CentOS 7](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-set-up-system-locale-on-centos-7/).
