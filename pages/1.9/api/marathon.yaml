          For backward compatibility, we will not change this behaviour, but let users opt in for a proper PUT.

          Note: We will change the default behaviour in the next Marathon version to support PATCH and PUT as HTTP methods.

In the case of multiple selectors, all must be satisfied so comma separator acts as an AND logical operator. Labels and values must consist of alphanumeric characters plus `-` `_` and `.` `-A-Za-z0-9_.`. Any other character is possible, but must be escaped with a backslash character.

        Change parameters of a deployed application group. The new group parameters get applied.


        * Changes to application parameters will result in a restart of this application.

        * A new application added to the group will be started.

        * An existing application removed from the group will be stopped.


        If there are no changes to the application definition, no restart is triggered. During restart marathon keeps track, that the configured amount of minimal running instances are _always_ available.

        This method allows 2 special modes for the update operation>


        * Provide only the `version` field in the group definition. This will rollback the group to that given version

        * Provide only the `scaleBy` field will scale all transitive applications instance counts by the given factor.


        When one of version or scaleBy are set, nothing else than a version change or transitive instance count scaling will be applied. If both version and scaleBy are set, only a version rollback will be performed - the scaleBy value will not be applied.

        A deployment can run forever. This is the case, when the new application has a problem and does not become healthy. In this case, human interaction is needed with 2 possible choices


        * Rollback to an existing older version

        * Update with a newer version of the group which does not have the problems of the old one.


        Since the deployment of the group can take a considerable amount of time, this endpoint returns immediately with a version. The failure or success of the action is signalled via event. There is a group_change_success and group_change_failed with the given version.

          Change parameters of a deployed application group. The new group parameters get applied.


          * Changes to application parameters will result in a restart of this application.

          * A new application added to the group will be started.

          * An existing application removed from the group will be stopped.


          If there are no changes to the application definition, no restart is triggered. During restart marathon keeps track, that the configured amount of minimal running instances are _always_ available.

          This method allows 2 special modes for the update operation>


          * Provide only the `version` field in the group definition. This will rollback the group to that given version

          * Provide only the `scaleBy` field will scale all transitive applications instance counts by the given factor.


          When one of version or scaleBy are set, nothing else than a version change or transitive instance count scaling will be applied. If both version and scaleBy are set, only a version rollback will be performed - the scaleBy value will not be applied.

          A deployment can run forever. This is the case, when the new application has a problem and does not become healthy. In this case, human interaction is needed with 2 possible choices


          * Rollback to an existing older version

          * Update with a newer version of the group which does not have the problems of the old one.


          Since the deployment of the group can take a considerable amount of time, this endpoint returns immediately with a version. The failure or success of the action is signalled via event. There is a group_change_success and group_change_failed with the given version.

        Change parameters of a deployed application group. The new group parameters get applied.


        * Changes to application parameters will result in a restart of this application.

        * A new application added to the group will be started.

        * An existing application removed from the group will be stopped.


        If there are no changes to the application definition, no restart is triggered. During restart marathon keeps track, that the configured amount of minimal running instances are _always_ available.

        This method allows 2 special modes for the update operation>


        * Provide only the `version` field in the group definition. This will rollback the group to that given version

        * Provide only the `scaleBy` field will scale all transitive applications instance counts by the given factor.


        When one of version or scaleBy are set, nothing else than a version change or transitive instance count scaling will be applied. If both version and scaleBy are set, only a version rollback will be performed - the scaleBy value will not be applied.

        A deployment can run forever. This is the case, when the new application has a problem and does not become healthy. In this case, human interaction is needed with 2 possible choices


        * Rollback to an existing older version

        * Update with a newer version of the group which does not have the problems of the old one.


        Since the deployment of the group can take a considerable amount of time, this endpoint returns immediately with a version. The failure or success of the action is signalled via event. There is a group_change_success and group_change_failed with the given version.

        To use this endpoint, the client has to accept the text/event-stream content type.

        Please note a request to this endpoint will not be closed by the server. If an event happens on the server side, this event will be propagated to the client immediately. See [Server Sent Events](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_serversentevents.asp) for a more detailed explanation.

        Note for ApiConsole&#58; this function will not yield the expected result from inside ApiConsole.

        This is mainly used for troubleshooting and occurs when scaling

        changes are requested and the volume of scaling changes out paces the ability to schedule those tasks.

        In addition to the application in the queue, you see also the task count that needs to be started.

        If the task has a rate limit, then a delay to the start gets applied.

        You can see this delay for every application with the seconds to wait before the next launch will be tried.

          This is mainly used for troubleshooting and occurs when scaling

          changes are requested and the volume of scaling changes out paces the ability to schedule those tasks.

          In addition to the application in the queue, you see also the task count that needs to be started.

          If the task has a rate limit, then a delay to the start gets applied.

          You can see this delay for every application with the seconds to wait before the next launch will be tried.

          A list of resource roles.

          Marathon considers only resource offers with roles in this list for

          launching tasks of this app. If you do not specify this,

          Marathon considers all resource offers with roles that have been

          configured by the `--default_accepted_resource_roles` command line flag.

          If no `--default_accepted_resource_roles` was given on startup,

          Marathon considers all resource offers. To register Marathon for a role,

          you need to specify the `--mesos_role` command line flag on startup.

          If you want to assign all resources of a slave to a role,

          you can use the `--default_role` argument when starting up the slave.

          If you need a more fine-grained configuration, you can use the

          `--resources` argument to specify resource shares per role.
